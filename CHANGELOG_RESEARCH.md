# Changelog research — 2026-09-08

## 2026-09-16 — published engine startup fix and final concurrency proofs

The qualified registry-only lock changes exactly five package records:
fsqlite/core 0.4.2, pager 0.4.3, btree/vdbe 0.4.1. Other family members remain
0.4.0 and Asupersync remains 0.5.0. Lock SHA-256:
`665f9fd7ca001beb2bf2f047572ceb4268914feb4904f12ab2990ee66884276a`.
Full archive-source comparisons link facade/pager to upstream `78134a656`
and core/btree/vdbe to `50972bf7c`. The core WAL adapter and vacuum source
match the previously isolated `683a241b` fix. This establishes publication
provenance, not runtime correctness by itself. Published vdbe 0.4.1 does not
include upstream's later `725e31ee7` discarded-rowid fix.

Current application source `a42db752` with these engine records passed
all-target/all-feature check and denied-warning Clippy, 3,161 library cases
(nine existing ignores), 22 MCP protocol cases, one shutdown case, 25
linearizability cases, 192 concurrency cases, 166 observational-open cases
(one existing ignore), 167 recovery replay cases and all 172 model cases.
The model suite includes all 120 generated sequences and the historical
300-issue/264-removal regression. The final model/concurrency/startup-benchmark
batch used overlay `2c7712a4367795eed49ea21eb11f480f8373d95bf73ae8c4d3ce1154f477ba79`.
Counts include shared test helpers and are not unique product scenarios.
Logs and real-family 8×60/8×90 stress receipts are indexed in `UPGRADE_LOG.md`.
Twenty startup-race rounds passed, versus ten failures in the twenty-round
0.4.0 comparison. The pins are adopted; no new release is claimed here.

The retained original-engine Windows executable separately passed three
workspace-waiter and five opener-lease tests through a natively compiled RCH
launcher. This is not evidence for the newer engine or a current CLI lifecycle.
The new replenishing-writer test records 57 real calls, their live registrations
and exact durable comment order; its passing result establishes observed bounded
progress, not strict arrival-time FIFO or universal scheduler liveness.

## 2026-09-15 — missing WAL shared-index startup recovery

Workstream `beads_rust-otrgz.2` addresses the three unchanged workspace replay
failures documented in `UPGRADE_LOG.md`. `db088c21` adds strict automatic-recovery
WAL validation; `868d658d` connects the existing backed-up, privately rehearsed
recovery to startup before the pending-merge inspection. Follow-up changes
preserve explicit read-only and observational sync contracts. Six focused CLI
tests passed through RCH, including WAL-only committed data and a legacy pending
receipt that must still block writes. Subsequent all-target/all-feature compiler
and denied-warning Clippy checks passed. No release or parent engine-workstream
completion is claimed.

The initial focused run failed its fixture oracle because explicit engine close
checkpointed the sentinel. Setup now uses the facade's non-checkpointing drop;
the assertion that the sentinel is absent from main and present in WAL remains.
The broader first run failed six fixture lookups because cached RCH binaries
referenced removed temporary source trees. Exact tracked fixture restoration
and a rerun are required; those failures are not counted as successful tests.

The added valid-current-receipt unit case then failed the same main-absence
oracle for a different reason: `SqliteStorage::drop` skipped its TRUNCATE for
peers but called `close_in_place`, whose engine implementation runs a passive
checkpoint. The fix uses `close_without_checkpoint_in_place` after the existing
admitted checkpoint. Both validator unit tests passed in that run; the valid
receipt test subsequently passed with whole-main equality against the
receipt-free baseline and exact recovered receipt equality. The original
contiguous-byte receipt search was invalid because a serialized receipt can
span WAL frames; that fixture oracle correction is recorded in `68bdc0b8`.

The next broad run passed 4,457 target cases and failed three. Doctor still
could not inspect missing-SHM families through its live read-only engine path.
A private snapshot fallback restored positive reads without live repair; all
167 unchanged workspace replay and 172 migration cases then passed, along with
CRUD, export atomicity, invariants and sync reconciliation. One health fixture
needed an explicit checkpoint for its raw header mutation; its original
assertions remain. The separate live-peer lifecycle failure also reproduces
on pre-change revision `b41234d0`, with all 1,156 tracked build inputs verified
against that revision; it remains an open engine blocker. Final snapshot
admission checks reject foreign-owned or
multiply linked namespace sources before copying; their final verification
is tracked in `UPGRADE_LOG.md`. Retained failed runs are not counted as passes.

Follow-up review found that opener registration formerly proceeded without a
lease after five seconds, and competing upgrades could drop both shared
registrations. Registration now fails closed; an additional transition lock
serializes upgrades and remains held if shared restoration fails. Doctor index
repair also retains sole-opener admission through connection teardown and
rollback. All-target/all-feature check and Clippy pass; runtime qualification
of these additions remains pending. The sync filesystem witness now recognizes
only the exact new transition-lock filename shape; JSONL publication's runtime
path allowlist is unchanged.

The final debug qualification on overlay `16a69c65` passed 4,047 target cases
and failed one filesystem-inventory assertion, with ten existing ignores.
The library contributed 3,160 passes; doctor chokepoint 186, unchanged replay
167, migration 172, reconciliation 189, and sync Git safety 173. Counts include
repeated harness cases. The failed inventory omitted the existing
`beads.db.fsqlite-migration-state` engine-family member; its exact suffix was
added without changing runtime JSONL publication permissions. Further raw-close
review added shared registration and non-checkpointing close to partial REINDEX
and the rollback-only write probe, and sole-opener admission to explicit WAL
truncation. A committed-WAL regression covers these paths. All-target/all-feature
check and Clippy pass on overlay `b8bb3b02`; final release-mode execution remains
pending. Current Windows-worker SSH probes timed out before authentication.

That release run subsequently passed all nine targets: 4,618 target cases,
zero failures and ten existing ignores, qualifying and closing `otrgz.2`.
Log: `/tmp/br-otrgz-release-runtime-pre-auto.log`. A separate source review
then found raw REINDEX's commit-time automatic checkpoint, so this result is
not evidence for the final doctor patch. `8785215b` explicitly disables
automatic checkpoints; `af2bd3f0` expands the real fixture beyond the engine's
4,000-frame urgent threshold. The new case and all 3,161 library cases pass
(nine existing ignores) on overlay `5f43c9a3`, with all-target/all-feature check
and Clippy passing as well. Log: `/tmp/br-otrgz-autocheckpoint-runtime.log`.
Final release doctor CLI qualification also passed: 186 tests, zero failures,
one existing ignore on the same `5f43c9a3` overlay, closing `otrgz.3`.
Log: `/tmp/br-otrgz-autocheckpoint-release-runtime.log`. Verification is root
re-execution; collaborator review is source evidence, not independent runtime
verification. No engine-parent closure or release publication is claimed.

## 2026-09-15 — CLI patch maintenance

Commits `3d0eb2dd` and `ae5b95bd` update clap/builder/derive to 4.6.7 and
clap_complete to 4.6.11. The final lockfile changes exactly those four package
records; engine, runtime and feature selections remain unchanged. Upstream
clap's deferred initialization is not enabled. Completion 4.6.11's static Zsh
escaping fix is outside br's dynamic registration path, so the changelog does
not claim a new escaping behavior in br. Exact upstream revisions, separate
dependency gates and final qualification results are recorded in `UPGRADE_LOG.md`.

## 2026-09-15 — isolated engine qualification

The current br source with the isolated upstream `683a241b` engine candidate
passed 3,561 test invocations through RCH: 3,151 library cases (nine existing
ignores), 191 concurrency cases, all 22 MCP protocol cases, 25 multiprocess
linearizability cases and 172 model-based cases. The latter includes all 120
generated sequences and the full historical 300-issue/264-removal regression.
No tests, timeouts or assertions changed. All three MCP startup failures on
the published 0.4.0 engine passed on this candidate, with FastMCP 0.10.0 and
Rustls 0.23.45 fixed. Exact source receipt and logs are in `UPGRADE_LOG.md`.
The same-current-source standalone startup probe then passed 10/20 rounds on
main's engine and 20/20 on the candidate. All baseline failures were the same
pre-dispatch database-busy refusal; every concurrent CLI observer succeeded.
Both eight-worker real-family stress gates also passed: 160 acknowledged
commands over 60 seconds and 244 over 90 seconds. All 75 nonzero outcomes
were expected validation refusals; integrity, database/JSONL equality, doctor
and recovery-artifact checks passed on both complete private copies.

This is experimental qualification evidence, not an adopted dependency update
or a release. Main's manifest and lockfile remain unchanged. The fix still
needs an aligned published engine family and qualification on the final pins;
`beads_rust-otrgz` and dependent `beads_rust-nx2sh` remain open.

## 2026-09-15 — published MCP dependencies and TLS patch

The FastMCP change at
[806819f9](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/806819f9)
replaces eight Git-source 0.9.0 crates with published 0.10.0 packages and their
required `dirs` 7.0.0 dependency. Exact prior Git revision and upstream tag
research are recorded in `UPGRADE_LOG.md`; br's existing Asupersync 0.5.0 pin
already matches the new release. Package inspection exposed local evidence
archives in Cargo's file set. Excluding `tests/artifacts/` shrank the package
from 96.2 MiB to 3.1 MiB without deleting evidence or excluding source inputs.

RCH compiler and Clippy checks passed, as did 3,151 library cases (nine existing
ignores), the shutdown test and ten manifest tests. MCP protocol results were
19 passing and three failing startup database-admission cases, before FastMCP
dispatch. These failures remain a qualification gate; no test was weakened.

The fresh advisory audit identified Rustls 0.23.43 as affected by
[RUSTSEC-2026-0285](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2026-0285.html).
Upstream [0.23.45](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/releases/tag/v/0.23.45)
fits all eight reverse-dependency constraints without engine/runtime upgrades.
The separate Rustls-only lock update clears the advisory audit. RCH compiler
and Clippy checks passed, followed by 3,151 library cases (nine existing
ignores), the shutdown test and ten package-manifest tests in the normal test
profile. Source overlay:
`3df607525f75f553a75aa3d8ae1848a0a1d0e7dc1e46d7e1d532f13660ad9689`.
Neither change is a published br release. The startup failures remain open;
full evidence and outstanding work remain in `UPGRADE_LOG.md`.

## 2026-09-15 — explicit engine admission recovery

The retained schema-17 family failed read-only admission because its legacy
SHM header had a zero page size. The September 14 private probe established
that the engine's existing-only writable open repairs SHM while preserving
main/WAL/journal bytes and all 1,086 issue rows; subsequent schema migration
and both real-family stress gates passed on the experimental engine candidate.
See `UPGRADE_LOG.md` for the evidence and remaining release gates.

The new `doctor migrate-schema recover` exposes that operation with complete
engine-family backup, private rehearsal, sole-opener admission, retained VFS
identity binding, protected-file byte checks, and a full logical comparison.
Initial implementation commits:
[e4c772af](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/e4c772af)
and [eaadcbe0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/eaadcbe0).
Validation completed under `beads_rust-otrgz.1`: RCH all-target/all-feature
compiler and denied-warning Clippy checks passed. Release/all-feature testing
passed 3,151 library tests (nine existing ignores) and all 165 schema-migration
end-to-end tests. The final source overlay fingerprint is
`0cd8eac713e217ced6b10cae21894d967cec64f13ed39afab36bf16fceeb41fe`.
The actual CLI then recovered a complete private copy of the retained family:
planning changed from `BusyRecovery` to eligible, all 1,086 issues remained,
and the original snapshot's bytes and filesystem identity remained unchanged.
Logs: `/tmp/br-otrgz1-{check,clippy,final-tests,cli-canary}.log`.
Formatting, diff checks and changelog structural validation passed. UBS exited
1 on whole-file findings; reviewed critical reports concern test assertions,
an existing filename nonce and non-secret witness comparisons, not a clean
scanner result. This is unreleased and does not qualify the dependency
candidate or change version pins.

## 2026-09-14 — routed-claim regression and engine follow-up

`beads_rust-ls72r` is now reproduced: a routed claim exits 4 for an explicitly
deferred external issue but changes the earlier local issue from `open` to
`in_progress`. The incoming `bb51b8a4` change narrowed lifecycle preflight to
closed issues. Restoring `SqliteStorage::validate_claim_target` during route
preparation catches deferred status and future deferral dates before any route
writes, while retaining the closed-claim refusal. Existing regression coverage
checks both route orders, `--force`, exports, labels and audit events.
Original runtime evidence: `/tmp/br-ls72r-claim-canary.log`. The full routing
target passed 216 tests first on the isolated engine candidate, then 216 tests
on the unchanged project dependency pins. The explicit-deferred runtime canary
now exits 4 with both issues unchanged (`open`, `deferred`). Evidence:
`/tmp/br-ls72r-pinned-routing-tests.log` and `/tmp/br-ls72r-fixed-canary.log`;
pinned-source overlay:
`baa3371c4d5db5224ff384e54a6e950a79f5effa365b31b5a274b75de4c6fb59`.
All-target/all-feature compiler and Clippy checks passed through RCH with
warnings denied (`/tmp/br-ls72r-final-checks.log`); formatting and diff checks
passed. This is unreleased work.

The isolated engine follow-up at upstream `683a241b` passes all 25 concurrency
tests but still fails the retained real-family migration preflight. The SHM
header has `is_init=1` and `sz_page=0`, which engine validation rejects before
the new empty-WAL reader handling. Main dependency pins remain unchanged;
see `UPGRADE_LOG.md` for source hashes, receipts and remaining qualification.

## 2026-09-13 — migration marker and concurrency qualification

`beads_rust-c2klf` adds `.fsqlite-migration-state` to the central config
database-family inventory. Doctor and temporary-database cleanup already had
explicit handling; config snapshot, recovery and orphan paths omitted it.
Cleanup now uses the central inventory without its duplicate append. Tests
cover marker bytes in snapshots, original-marker restoration after a failed
replacement, orphan quarantine, symlink refusal and existing complete cleanup.
Through RCH on the original 0.4.0 dependency set, all six targeted release-mode
tests passed, followed by all 209 configuration tests with no failures or
ignores. Source and manifest/lockfile hashes matched the controller checkout.
Evidence: `/tmp/br-c2klf-{targeted-tests,config-tests}.log`, overlay
`a83f7b923259ec94614d42e1d5d7ca19fdce7920c915c34e81832fe464f713f2`.
All-target/all-feature compiler and Clippy checks passed through RCH with
warnings denied; formatting and diff checks passed. Evidence:
`/tmp/br-c2klf-{check,clippy}.log`. This is unreleased work.

`beads_rust-otrgz` records a separate real concurrency failure on FrankenSQLite
0.4.0: nine operations in the eight-process/30-second gate and 18 in isolation,
both below its unchanged minimum of 100. Syscall traces retained under
`/tmp/br-otrgz-strace/` show a shared-to-exclusive maintenance lock cycle during
read-only opens. Published 0.4.1 fixes constructor WAL adoption. An isolated
candidate passed the original gate with 305 operations and no failed calls;
the full target then passed all 25 tests, including its planted-liar negative
control, with 304 operations and no failed calls. Evidence:
`/tmp/br-otrgz-published-041-{concurrency,full-concurrency}.log`.

Only `fsqlite`, `fsqlite-core` and `fsqlite-pager` have published 0.4.1 packages;
the remaining engine packages are 0.4.0. Main retains its original dependency
pins. This mixed-version experiment is not a completed engine upgrade or
release qualification. See `UPGRADE_LOG.md` for upstream commits and remaining
gates. No new release or replacement of v0.6.0 assets is claimed.

## 2026-09-12 — unreleased JSONL exchange guard (qualification in progress)

`beads_rust-og86t` addresses the separate export failure reproduced in
`/tmp/br-q93wv-sync-observation.jsonl`. The implementation in `src/sync/mod.rs`
probes disposable siblings through the retained parent capability before
exchanging an existing export. It rejects lying success and mutating errors;
explicit unsupported errors permit the existing fallback only after both
probe identities are verified unchanged. Failed probes and the staged export
are retained. No path allowlist or live-generation witness was loosened.

The initial implementation was committed as `e97ce12c` by a concurrent session
before this qualification finished. Current source includes the concurrent
FrankenSQLite 0.4.0 / Asupersync 0.5.0 dependency update and Git-pinned FastMCP.
RCH all-target/all-feature check and Clippy with warnings denied passed on
those dependencies; formatting passed. A remote snapshot comparison matched
all 4,169 tracked files at capture. The earlier 544-test sync pass used
FrankenSQLite 0.3.18 and is preliminary evidence only. The current-dependency
sync unit run subsequently passed 544 tests with zero failures and one
intentionally ignored scale-timing probe, including all three new probe
regressions and the sync source/direct-runtime dependency safety tests.
Evidence: `/tmp/br-og86t-current-{check,clippy,sync-unit}.log`.

The current ARM64 GNU binary was built through RCH and its worker/Mac SHA-256
matched: `bbf965f78331e6ab6be291b029e54e519099c7e3e5cc4785e80b70f90ae7964d`.
On native aarch64 Docker, replacing a nonempty export passed on a native Linux
volume and cleaned the probes. The writable macOS bind-mount run refused
before publication, preserving the old export's SHA-256, inode, device and
size, retaining the staged update, and preserving the database update.
Evidence: `/tmp/br-og86t-{native,bind}-runtime.jsonl`; assertion harness:
`/tmp/br-og86t-export-canary.py`.

The release-mode all-feature library run passed 3,144 tests with nine existing
ignored probes/tests. The binary suite passed 66 tests and failed
`fast_open_import_reprobe_reopens_the_canonical_database_inode` with
`Database(BusyRecovery)`; the failure also reproduced in isolation. This is
tracked as `beads_rust-1khz0`, not hidden by the successful sync checks. The
resolved all-feature normal dependency tree had no forbidden Git authority
packages (RCH `exec --job`; ordinary `exec` rejected this non-compilation
command).

Follow-up, 2026-09-13: the startup fixture constructed its replacement at the
still-open canonical path; the old reader's opener lease prevented the new
family from checkpointing there. Moving the omitted migration-state sidecar
alone did not fix it. Independently staging and closing the replacement,
then publishing the complete family, passed while retaining the old handle.
The corrected test also asserts that the canonical inode changes and the
displaced original inode remains available. All 67 release-mode binary tests
then passed. Final all-target/all-feature check and Clippy passed after
removing temporary diagnostic code; no production startup code was changed.
Evidence: `/tmp/br-1khz0-release-bin.log`, `/tmp/br-og86t-final-check.log`,
`/tmp/br-og86t-final-clippy2.log`. The original failed family survives on ts2
under `/tmp/br-1khz0-reprobe-evidence/.tmpjurUqP`, with a controller manifest
at `/tmp/br-1khz0-family-manifest.jsonl`. The separate central sidecar inventory
omission is tracked as `beads_rust-c2klf`.

The release-mode Git-authority integration gate passed all 174 tests. The
reconciliation target initially passed 188 tests and failed the source-repo
path migration test. Its inspection handle remained alive across later CLI
writes; releasing it after reading the owned issue records fixed the fixture
without changing production locking. The complete reconciliation rerun passed
all 189 tests (`beads_rust-0fk9j`, commit `0b241050`). Evidence:
`/tmp/br-og86t-release-sync-gates.log` and
`/tmp/br-og86t-release-sync-gates2.log`.
Post-edit RCH all-target/all-feature check and Clippy with warnings denied
also passed, as did formatting and whitespace checks. The fixture bead is
closed; logs are `/tmp/br-0fk9j-{check,clippy}.log`.

The following status-health target passed 169 tests but failed three fixture
catalog tests: its cached binary embeds a removed RCH clean-overlay source
directory, `/data/tmp/rch/br-q93wv-20260912/2c9af36118d80c04`. That missing
directory was independently verified. Restoring the unchanged fixtures there
resolved all three failures; all 120 copied files matched the source snapshot,
and the fixture tree had no changes from the original build baseline. The
rerun passed 172 status-health tests and 181 VCS tests with zero failures.
Evidence: `/tmp/br-og86t-restored-fixtures.json` and
`/tmp/br-og86t-release-sync-gates3.log`. Remaining integration targets and the
full release suite remain pending. No release artifact has been replaced and
the JSONL exchange bead remains open.

The remaining sync targets subsequently passed: artifacts 173, failure
injection 183, fuzz/edge cases 175, needs-flush guard 166, and preflight 174.
The failure-injection target initially failed its post-export crash probe
because the fixture kept the direct exporter open while invoking the CLI.
Moving its existing `drop(storage)` before the probe models the exited
exporter; dirty-state and recovery assertions remain unchanged and pass.
This does not establish a new live-peer concurrency guarantee. Evidence:
`/tmp/br-og86t-release-sync-remaining.log` (initial failure) and
`/tmp/br-og86t-release-sync-remaining2.log` (passing rerun). The nine sync/VCS
integration targets total 1,587 passing cases, including shared harness tests
compiled into multiple targets. Broader release-suite qualification is still
pending. Post-edit all-target/all-feature check and Clippy with warnings
denied passed through RCH; formatting and whitespace checks passed too.
Compiler evidence: `/tmp/br-og86t-crash-fixture-{check,clippy}.log`.

## 2026-09-12 — unreleased shared-mount migration guard

Narrow follow-up scope: `beads_rust-q93wv`, after v0.6.0. Git history through
`5c4ea26b` contains only release records and the bug claim after the frozen
release source. GitHub still reports v0.6.0 published at 04:05:02 UTC.

A real `renameat2(RENAME_EXCHANGE)` probe on the affected macOS Docker bind
mount returned success while removing the source pathname and replacing the
destination; the native Linux volume swapped both files correctly. Both
original failed migration backups were independently checked against every
raw-family presence, length and SHA-256 entry in their prepared receipts.
Evidence: `/tmp/br-q93wv-{bind,native}-identity.jsonl` and
`/tmp/br-q93wv-original-backup-verification.jsonl` on the controller.
The guard probes locked disposable files before apply/resume and
non-dry-run undo; the existing live authority witnesses are unchanged.
Clippy caught standard-library lock calls newer than the manifest's declared
MSRV; the final patch uses the existing Rustix nonblocking exclusive lock.
Final-source RCH gates passed: all-target/all-feature check and Clippy with
warnings denied, 177 schema unit tests (including all 40 migration tests),
and five schema CLI tests. Earlier broader CLI/doctor suites passed 350 tests
with one pre-existing ignored doctor repair dry-run test.

The final ARM64 GNU binary was built through RCH and executed on native
aarch64 Docker. On the writable macOS bind mount, apply and undo refused
before changing database-family/JSONL bytes, inode identities or device IDs;
the failed probes remained available. Undo dry-run succeeded without a probe.
On a native Linux volume, schema 15 → 19 migration and byte-exact undo passed.
Binary SHA-256:
`4f8bcd2bfda2f715a3b4869d12c7c3fbb59da98f50cc6c49b10a1461f032ca7b`.
Runtime records: `/tmp/br-q93wv-{bind,native,undo}-runtime.jsonl`; assertion
harnesses: `/tmp/br-q93wv-{migration,undo}-canary.py`. The changelog entry is
explicitly Unreleased; no v0.6.0 artifact was replaced.

The separate JSONL publication caller also reproduces the shared-mount
failure: `sync --flush-only` changes the output, then reports an uncertified
publication and a nonexistent recovery path. `beads_rust-og86t` tracks that
unfixed sync issue with `/tmp/br-q93wv-sync-observation.jsonl`; this migration
fix does not claim to qualify general JSONL publication on that mount.

## 2026-09-12 — v0.6.0 publication verified

GitHub release `387447968` was published at 04:05:02 UTC from frozen commit
`b1cfebe05437463e91a353cf2bedafac27266f5b`. Its 24 assets passed authenticated
draft and unauthenticated public download verification: exact names, hashes,
sizes, all seven Minisign signatures, aggregate checksums and archive payloads.
All seven downloaded binaries passed CLI/migration canaries. The crate's
registry checksum matches the separately qualified upload payload. Homebrew
and Scoop updates are live and passed real installation checks; public
installers and 0.5.12 upgrades passed on Linux amd64 and Apple Silicon.

All source tests, seven-target build/runtime evidence, source-byte comparisons,
retained failed attempts and existing limitations are recorded in
[UPGRADE_LOG.md](UPGRADE_LOG.md). No GitHub Actions were run. Intel macOS ran
under Rosetta, not physical Intel hardware. Both Arch packages are prepared
and amd64 installation passed, but AUR SSH authentication remains unavailable;
the release bead remains open and AUR publication is not claimed. The
chronological preparation entries below retain their historical pending states.

## 2026-09-11 — dependency update and next release preparation

Qualification update, 2026-09-12 03:43 UTC: source is frozen at
`b1cfebe05437463e91a353cf2bedafac27266f5b`. The 625 version-sensitive checks
passed through RCH. Six raw release targets have passed CLI/migration and
doctor qualification; Unix targets also passed real-PTY checks. Intel macOS
ran under Rosetta on Apple Silicon. ARM musl is still building, and no 0.6.0
venue is published. The exact packaged crate passed default/all-feature builds,
22 MCP protocol tests and default-binary runtime checks; its publication dry
run preserved SHA-256
`0d0fbac9a6c83b1ee48ab585f3d5f3fe9c8005a05cab7e039502d9293ed1cecf`.

Release canaries found an existing schema-migration limitation on writable
Docker Desktop macOS bind mounts. The published 0.5.12 Linux arm64 binary and
the candidate both refused migration with a locked-file identity change; the
candidate passed the same migration checks on a native Docker volume.
`beads_rust-q93wv` tracks this unresolved issue. Evidence is retained in
`/tmp/br-4e2n1-evidence-20260912/linux-arm64-runtime.log`,
`bindmount-baseline-0512.log`, and `linux-arm64-native-volume-runtime.log`.
The changelog distinguishes the supported migration routes from this unfixed
mount-specific failure. No claim of a regression fix is made.

The release campaign is tracked by `beads_rust-4e2n1`. Live release metadata
still identifies v0.5.12 (published 2026-09-09 02:07:08 UTC) as the latest
release. Reviewed the complete `v0.5.12..a22c251b` commit range against the
Unreleased section: prerequisites, class-specific workflow routes, typed
relationships/schema 19, reviewed legacy migration, claim guards, ordered
writer admission, expired-lock refusal and bounded ready output are covered.
The section is now assigned to pending v0.6.0, which has no remote tag,
GitHub release or crates.io version at the availability check. Source changes
and passing Linux tests do not establish seven-platform release qualification.

The dependency inventory and published-source research are recorded in
[UPGRADE_LOG.md](UPGRADE_LOG.md). FastMCP 0.9.0, asupersync 0.4.10 and TOML
1.1.5 form one resolvable update because FastMCP pins the latter two exactly.
FrankenSQLite stays at 0.3.18. Baseline and candidate each passed 3,138 active
library tests with the same nine ignores through RCH. The full integration
shards, default/no-default libraries, binary/ordinary benchmark targets,
all-target check and Clippy subsequently passed; the doc command had zero
executable cases and ten existing ignores. Version-sensitive checks and actual
release binaries remain pending. Fresh RustSec audit found zero vulnerabilities,
including without project exclusions. No speedup, Windows qualification or
publication is inferred from these results.

## 2026-09-11 — bounded ready output follow-through

Implementation `16cb8245` connects positive JSON/TOON ready limits to the
existing bounded storage query. External dependency filtering still precedes
truncation, and text output retains the complete total. Complete-row regression
comparisons cover hybrid, priority and oldest ordering at limits 1, 2, 3, 5
and 10, plus an externally blocked leading row with an independent survivor.

Strict RCH validation on hz4 passed all-feature/all-target `cargo check` and
Clippy with warnings denied. Four release test targets (`e2e_ready`,
`e2e_ready_limit`, `storage_ready`, `snapshots`) passed 810 test invocations,
with no failures or ignores. The tested source, manifest, lockfile and
toolchain hashes match committed tree `9591dd1b`. These are targeted checks,
not a new whole-suite or native Windows qualification.

Receipts are retained under
`/data/tmp/br-3dzbd-ready-limit-20260911-w60hpYP2/`. The retrieved default
release candidate is 27,713,440 bytes, SHA-256
`ccea777c07cd440bdae2aeecb2110722f78cb02f62b0a51ebf257e1bb4b5804d`.
Its matched pre-change release baseline is retained separately. The bounded
before/after comparison completed but failed its qualification criteria;
no speedup is claimed. Static UBS
scanning of the two changed Rust files reports zero critical findings, 293
warnings and 27 informational findings; this is not a warning-free audit.
Changed-hunk review found test assertions and diagnostic-name allocations;
the existing production indexing warning is guarded by a length check.
Bead `beads_rust-3dzbd` is closed for its original implementation, regression
and comparison-report scope. Qualified performance evidence remains under
the existing calibration bead `beads_rust-zxfz.1`; the failed timing
qualification is unchanged and no performance benefit is accepted.

The prospectively fixed A-B-B-A comparison ran through strict RCH on
vmi1167313, with one copied workspace per block, three warmups and 40 measured
calls per block. All 160 measured calls matched the 7,243-byte expected output
and preserved database-family hashes. Only the first baseline block passed
both quietness and stability requirements. Foreign compiler processes appeared
during both candidate blocks; the final baseline block also exceeded the
1.10 p95 epoch-ratio threshold. No block was retried or dropped.

Descriptive pooled results (80 calls per binary) were baseline/candidate
median 161.11/152.90 ms, p95 232.81/237.20 ms, and median peak RSS
73,252/69,144 KiB. These contaminated, unstable samples do not establish a
latency or memory improvement. Full receipts are retained in `abba-retained/`
under the directory above; the compressed receipt archive SHA-256 is
`acdca6429856dc52082216abb9563e4b6409be9a4ee62f1000a6326e313c7dd9`.
The original held-out performance-calibration data was not opened.

Requested scope: audit the latest release using `changelog-md-workmanship`.
The existing earlier history is retained; this is not a full-history re-audit.

## Evidence spine

- Repository: https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust
- Frozen v0.5.11 source: `b42de9b9aad92d91c926c40a613b73479962e776`.
- GitHub published v0.5.11 at `2026-09-08T02:24:24Z`.
- Initial GitHub release-list query shows v0.5.1 is a published release,
  contradicting the current timeline's combined v0.5.1/v0.5.0 tag-only row.
- Recent release dates mix tag dates with publication dates: v0.5.4 was
  published August 29 UTC and v0.5.2 August 26 UTC. Verify the complete recent
  line before correcting it; explicitly document its date convention.
- Existing v0.5.11 notes repeat connection reuse and sidecar changes and mix
  older v0.5.7-to-v0.5.10 timing measurements into the new release section.

## Boundaries

Use Git diffs first, then tag/release metadata, checked-in `.beads/issues.jsonl`,
and supporting docs. Do not infer completed migrations, contention fairness,
or calibrated performance from a passing release build. Keep AUR publication
open unless there is evidence it was pushed. Never move the frozen release tag.

Research chunks will be recorded here and distilled into `CHANGELOG.md` as
they finish. Earlier version prose outside concrete verified corrections is
outside this update's audit scope.

## Chunk 1 — version spine (distilled)

The complete GitHub release list returned 60 published releases (all non-draft,
non-prerelease). v0.5.1 has 50 assets; v0.5.0, v0.5.8, and v0.5.9 have no
published release. Corrected the recent timeline, corresponding section
headings, and tag links. Release publication dates corrected to UTC:
v0.5.2 August 26; v0.5.4 August 29; milestone v0.4.0 August 23. The v0.5.11
API returns 24 assets: seven archives, seven SHA-256 sidecars, seven Minisign
signatures, an aggregate checksum file, and two SBOMs. The release target is
the frozen b42de9b9 source, not the subsequent packaging commits.

## Chunk 2 — runtime and contracts (distilled)

Inspected the complete range's subjects/file coverage and representative source
diffs: 222dd050/b1dfa462 teardown and grouped-count integration; cb92e944 import
verification and connection reuse; dbcf1ebe close reuse; de4b231b migration
preflight and retry safety; dac8ea99/0a12d6a0/bee3df3e sidecar admission and
engine pins; f81fdc03 MCP policy/publication/resource and init/schema contracts;
829a8357 environment alias; 29a79f9d upgrade tag; e824f4dc/e5e86232 deferral;
bbd1e44f/b6e95891 cache maintenance; 48636625 index diagnostics.

Key corrections: the original summary omitted the MCP URI change and exact
init receipt; blanket retryability was too broad; migration refusal applies
to unsupported core-table layouts, not just duplicate typed edges. The
remaining-budget change in b9b8839e corrects a test's expectation, not the
production polling/deadline algorithm. Do not credit it as a new scheduler.
Earlier v0.5.7-to-v0.5.10 timing observations belong with v0.5.10, not as proof
of a v0.5.11 speedup. Tracker naul5 explicitly retains small-fixture slowdowns.

Source records at published b330072c: 05rjp line 2; ro3m 859; 72j0i 332;
5cxmj 298; naul5 772; azxef.1 482; azxef.2 489; azxef.12 485.
Open boundaries: yyhki 1045, 46zqi 265, zxfz.1 1063. These immutable JSONL
line links avoid unstable links to a changing main-branch tracker.

## Chunk 3 — verification and tooling (distilled)

Reviewed the test/workflow commit inventory, benchmark comparator controls,
conformance refusal/retention diff, concurrent history capture, and source-bound
05rjp coverage notes. f81fdc03 extends independent models and real stdio policy
tests; b9b58dbe fixes model orientation; 9bad2299 adds final quiescent reads;
305687e1 and 51521b96 preserve failures; 3828b602 checks actual init files.
658b62ee/0347b90b/2298d899 add conditional quantile inference, boot identity,
and collection shards. Their commits explicitly leave calibration unfinished.
52ee71c1/954156ac fix benchmark artifact staging/context; no new product
capability is inferred from those plumbing changes.

Earlier workflow fixes are historical evidence only: f25efeff toolchain,
2d8232c5 event concurrency, 20014205 snapshot scope, cb92e944 E2E precompilation,
b9b58dbe close-reason matching/dev E2E, c1525c80 lock allowlist/collation,
58a3e74f and b1dfa462 action-pin updates. Existing ignores and environment
skips remain described (65b44361, 761e782c, e1b8ace0, 9bad2299).

The 149-target count is target coverage, not a count of unique assertions.
Library/binary counts and all ignores are transcribed from 05rjp; this audit
does not rerun or re-certify that historical campaign. Benchmark timings from
088f5b53 are moved into v0.5.10 with their original two-version scope. Closed
workstreams link to their exact b330072c records; open goals remain separate.

## Chunk 4 — post-tag distribution (distilled)

All six commits reviewed: 7858e054 Linux package hashes; 4621308e archive-size
receipts; b70a288d published release/hash/README updates; 60613b20 venue proof
and AUR blocker; 38ccff60 Arch byte preservation; b330072c Homebrew alignment,
nightly-aware documentation, and existing manifest assertions. Source diffs
confirm these follow the b42de9b9 tag; binary changes are not implied.

Live registry check: crates.io 0.5.11 published `2026-09-08T02:24:53.919856Z`,
not yanked, checksum
`11b6b4d808810640fb78685f725eb7f2c258f326d1a38c91f7481cbdec100627`.
GitHub confirms Homebrew commit dbcd7d7f3b532f763f3b52099a000ced06429bfa and
Scoop commit 564dda951de3eb1ee20d9745845da38a05aeeec7. Frozen formula/manifest
links allow inspection of the published package metadata. Bead vq1xl line 980
contains installation receipts and the unresolved AUR authorization boundary.

Initial skill validator passes structural checks with two advisories in
retained earlier history: bare-hash candidates (also matching a Minisign key
ID) and the phrase `and more`. The bounded release rewrite does not erase or
claim to audit every earlier narrative to satisfy those heuristic warnings.
Live-link checks follow separately with the required project HTTP User-Agent;
the skill validator's network mode hard-codes a different User-Agent.

## Final validation

- Read back the completed sections and checked their claims against the
  researched sources. Corrected the draft's ambiguous "ignored probe removed"
  wording: the probe is enabled, not deleted.
- Skill script run directly: structural validation passes; the two earlier
  history advisories above remain disclosed. `git diff --check` passes.
- 90 distinct links checked across current navigation, release/follow-up
  sections, and all added URLs: 89 initially returned HTTP 200. Both HEAD and
  GET returned 404 for the crates.io web page. Replaced it with the official
  version API, which returns HTTP 200 and the exact published version/checksum.
- Every linked release representative (34 distinct commits) belongs to
  `v0.5.10..v0.5.11`; every post-tag representative (five distinct commits)
  belongs to `v0.5.11..b330072c`. The six-commit post-tag inventory also includes
  the evidence-only 4621308e, which needs no separate changelog bullet.
- All 18 Beads link occurrences resolve to their named records at b330072c;
  every record in Completed workstreams is closed. Local doc links exist.
- This change edits documentation and the release bead only. No Cargo suite
  was rerun, no historical test success was relabeled as fresh verification,
  and no GitHub Actions were run.

Delivery: [4b3b7b19](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/4b3b7b191f7a0c0b7d5a582d8afe9cf15ed1a37f)
was pushed and both remote branch tips were verified at that commit. The
release tag remains b42de9b9. This final completion record accompanies the
delivered documentation; vq1xl remains blocked only for its unresolved AUR step.

## September 8 continuation — unreleased fixes

The existing historical reconstruction is retained. This bounded continuation
reviews `b330072c..53fbfd41`: five runtime/build fixes, their regression tests,
the documentation corrections, and the intervening plan/tracker records.
Read the actual implementation diffs for 584e9081 (closed claims), 0c6a05f2
(search page selection), 503415c4 (engine-open explanation routing), 7a8aa3e1
(Nix source root), and 1bd33da0 (trusted styling and configuration precedence).
Read 4fe8e47b/3a6bc0d8 for the user-facing documentation corrections. The other
commits record research, plans, or tests; they do not add runtime capabilities.

The September 8 GitHub API recheck still identifies v0.5.11, published at
02:24:24 UTC with 24 assets, as the latest release. These later changes belong
under Unreleased. Do not copy the search commit's one-host timing observations
into a universal performance promise. The stronger eef72c58 claim regression
is undergoing current-source qualification, not a new published guarantee.
Nix package construction and the required Rust gates remain in progress under
i9yzo; no build success or new release is inferred from this changelog update.

### Qualification follow-through at e77ba905 (September 8)

Reviewed the complete e77ba905 diff: three namespace diagnostic messages,
five real engine open-lane probes, the separated positive claim test,
the stable Nix package set/current Darwin SDK interface, test debug profile,
and the exact agent version-example correction from 0.5.10 to 0.5.11.
No runtime behavior is inferred from tracker-only changes. The original
schema-test failure is retained; the full schema target passed after the
single-field correction, without snapshot regeneration.

The four Nix outputs evaluated successfully. Native Linux amd64 construction
produced `/nix/store/1457jm60j6r0bdr9b3xwljvl33r32ssd-beads_rust-0.5.11`,
whose binary SHA-256 is
`001bf43acf4ace6ccc2c08f2960aa1a09b6a86c423cdc98fe2cbaaa15149a951`.
Its 45-step self-test passed with default `self_update` and FrankenSQLite
0.3.18. Nix used the September 8 Fenix nightly; the RCH checks use the pinned
August 31 nightly. Evaluation alone does not establish the other three
Nix builds or seven-target DSR release success.

The same-target all-features CLI sizes were 1,417,694,056 bytes before the
test-profile change and 470,013,824 bytes afterward. The latter retains
`.debug_line`, passed 45 self-test steps, and has SHA-256
`3edf33e2f8ccabf1e0812f03d8bfb282dac29f657668ad8b3196cf65215ce515`.
Neither number is a release-binary budget measurement or a latency claim.
Required whole-target check/Clippy and affected CLI, docs, Markdown, and
MCP tests passed. Common dataset helpers and pinned-BV goldens that returned
early are not credited as exercised coverage. Full current-library and
feature-mode qualification remain in progress; prior timeouts remain failures.

Raw command output and the source manifest are retained under
`/data/tmp/br-i9yzo-20260908-rdczih`; Beads i9yzo comments 1435–1437 and
xmrw6 comment 1436 record the exact test scope, skips, and independent review.
The new changes remain Unreleased; published v0.5.11 assets are unchanged.

### Terminal controls and source qualification at d42ced50 (September 9 UTC)

Reviewed the complete runtime, CLI-reference, and regression-test diff.
Configured text layouts, tracing diagnostics, and human errors now honor
nonempty `NO_COLOR`, `--no-color`, and `TERM=dumb`; empty `NO_COLOR` retains
normal styling. The tests examine raw terminal bytes before normalization,
require retained diagnostics/content, and keep positive colored-output checks.
No golden snapshots were regenerated.

The final source passes strict-RCH all-target/all-feature check and Clippy,
formatting, four affected output targets in debug and release profiles,
365 selected library tests and 67 binary tests. Existing ignored tests,
shared dataset helpers that return early, and zero-run doctests receive no
coverage credit. Earlier whole-library, MCP, search, namespace, and Nix
proofs apply only to their unchanged source surfaces; the Nix construction
proof does not claim the later terminal changes were built by Nix.

The freshly downloaded all-features Linux release-profile binary has SHA-256
`573f4c9d9f2aa39286172fb7ebcc18213de86cad2fc0851a4936374c8c02fe3d`.
Its embedded Git revision is stale worker metadata; source identity instead
comes from matching all 298 Rust/key build files with this commit's code.
It passed 51 claim/output/namespace canary commands, 29 actual PTY commands,
and all 45 self-test steps. An older binary still fails the same terminal
driver on ANSI diagnostics under `NO_COLOR`. The first fresh PTY run found
a fixture title wrapping across table rows; the shorter fixture retains all
byte/content assertions, and both failed and corrected runs are preserved.

Evidence is in the existing qualification root above and
`/data/tmp/br-phm7n-20260908-7sPfyV`; i9yzo comment 1446 records the final
acceptance and bounded solo review. These are source-qualification results,
not seven-platform release or publication receipts. GitHub Actions remain
disabled, and v0.5.11 still has its original 24 assets.

### September 9 — acceptance presence after the v0.5.12 freeze

Reviewed the complete `src/close_policy.rs`, `tests/e2e_errors.rs`, and
CLI-reference diff after frozen source `366c69a63fe18260afc4deff798850053954cac9`.
The new opt-in spelling is `acceptance_criteria_present`; the completion rule
is unchanged. Exact-edge and target-state rules compose. The real CLI matrix
checks prospective text, checked and unchecked checklists, prose, absent or
blank values, both batch orders, fresh comments, and unchanged persisted state
after refusal. Destructive text replacement first encounters the existing
overwrite guard; explicit `--force` still cannot bypass the policy.

Strict RCH passed 111 policy units, 237 CLI error tests, 10 MCP protocol tests,
and all-target/all-feature Clippy and check. The first new test run failed
because it expected the internal comment field name instead of JSON `text`
and overlooked the overwrite guard; the corrected tests retain both guards'
state-preservation assertions. Initial whole-target lint/check attempts hit
the unchanged 300-second cap; documented split runs warmed the same worker,
then whole-target commands passed. Formatting and `git diff --check` pass.
No snapshots, ignored tests, lint suppressions, or time limits changed.

This closes only the presence implementation subtask. Bead g8cib remains open
for a distinct prerequisite field and its CLI/MCP/storage/sync behavior;
7zm00 retains the full proof matrix. The existing MCP suite passed, but does
not itself establish a new presence-specific MCP scenario. These changes do
not belong in the pending v0.5.12 release notes or packaged source.

### September 9 — v0.5.12 publication and distribution

GitHub release 385174315 became public at 02:07:08 UTC, with tag v0.5.12
pointing to `366c69a63fe18260afc4deff798850053954cac9`. The publication did
not move the tag or include the later acceptance-presence implementation.
The release API and independent unauthenticated downloads establish the
complete 24-asset set: seven archives, seven SHA-256 sidecars, seven Minisign
signatures, an aggregate checksum file, and SPDX/CycloneDX source inventories.
Every archive contains exactly its binary, README.md, and LICENSE. All seven
signatures verified with the established release key (ID 36B847D11BA5A0D0).
The source inventories include every one of the 633 Cargo.lock packages;
they are source inventories, not assertions about linked binary dependencies.

DSR v0.1.2 at `87d0be6c6fdf8536decd1663fe2975f13bc9094f` built the artifacts
without Actions, act, or dispatch. The original seven-target run completed
four targets and failed three; its GNU amd64 output also exceeded the intended
glibc floor. Those results remain retained and were not relabeled successful.
Separate GNU and musl runs supplied the four accepted Linux binaries. All
4,169 tracked source files matched the frozen source in every selected build
snapshot. GNU outputs require at most GLIBC 2.28; both musl outputs have no
interpreter, dynamic dependency, or GLIBC references. All seven binaries and
archives fit the unchanged size budgets against both v0.5.10 and v0.5.11.

DSR's strict publisher validated and uploaded its supported 16-asset contract
to a draft. Its first attempt to describe the established 24-asset layout
failed before publication; that failure remains recorded. The operator then
uploaded the eight already-verified signature/aggregate files while the
release was still a draft. Independent verification required the final exact
24 assets before publication and repeated the check on public downloads.
This is not a claim that the older DSR manifest schema accepts every layout.

All seven GitHub-downloaded binaries passed platform CLI canaries and 45
doctor self-test steps. The six Unix targets also passed 29 real PTY checks;
their CLI driver has 51 commands, while Windows has 48. macOS Intel ran under
Rosetta; Linux arm64 ran in native arm64 containers. These checks do not
establish every reconcile invariant or the other three Nix package builds.
Windows retains five existing dead-code warnings; no warning-free Windows
build is claimed.

Crates.io published 0.5.12 at 02:07:38 UTC. Its version API reports an unyanked
3,805,711-byte package with SHA-256
`6d555b0649b2fc85705a71f87019fee5417c5f6daf5a10cd13c60edfd4b23330`, exactly
the separately qualified package. That extracted package compiled with all
features through strict RCH and its binary passed 51 CLI canaries and 45
self-test steps. Publishing used `--no-verify` after that separate compile.
Packaged repository-contract tests are not all green: two AGENTS contract
checks require excluded docs/scripts/tracker files, and two of 235 CLI error
tests require excluded database fixtures. Those failures remain evidence;
they are not credited as passes or masked with new skips.

The public Homebrew formula commit is `1ec62f2`; Scoop is `f054ed8`. Both
repositories had Actions disabled before their pushes. Native Apple Silicon
Homebrew upgraded 0.5.11 to 0.5.12, passed its formula test and all 45 doctor
steps, and retained the exact published binary hash. Both Arch package
architectures built with upstream binary bytes and license preserved; native
x86_64 pacman integrity reported seven files and zero alterations, and 45
doctor steps passed. The aarch64 package has packaging proof only. AUR still
needs an authorized publication credential, so the release bead remains open.

Raw build, publication, installation, checksum, and signature receipts are
retained under `/data/tmp/br-phm7n-20260908-7sPfyV` and the remote paths recorded
in Bead phm7n comments 1461–1465. No registry success is inferred merely from
a manifest version bump, and unfinished post-freeze features remain Unreleased.

Installation follow-through: the public latest installer passed on Linux
amd64 and two separate Apple Silicon machines. Real `br upgrade --json` runs
on isolated copies of 0.5.11 selected public 0.5.12 on Linux amd64 and Apple
Silicon, replaced themselves with the exact published binary, and passed all
45 doctor steps. The initial Mac follow-up used a nonexistent self-test flag
and exited 2; the corrected `--keep` invocation and original failure are
both retained. No installer or product guard was changed to obtain a pass.

Native Windows Scoop installed the public manifest and independently fetched
public archive, with normal checksum verification enabled, then passed all
45 doctor steps with the exact Windows binary. The portable-client bootstrap
emitted a nonterminating missing-shims-directory diagnostic before creating
that directory; it remains in the captured PowerShell error stream. A separate
shim invocation verifies the installed command launches version 0.5.12.

### September 9 — distinct prerequisites and command discovery

Reviewed the complete prerequisite change now committed in
`f9adebc0..b5f3fcac`: model/storage, schema-18 migration, policy, CLI/rendering,
MCP, schemas/docs, and regression tests. The shared tree was committed by
another session during qualification; that did not itself close g8cib or
7zm00. The new field is independent of acceptance criteria. The opt-in
`prerequisites_complete` rule requires a nonempty real checklist with no
unchecked items and composes with presence, completion, and fresh-comment
requirements. Storage evaluates replacements inside the existing atomic
transition preflight. Absent/empty prerequisites preserve the old content
hash; nonempty content participates in hashing, merge equality, and JSONL.

Candidate SHA-256
`058bc11c165b95c46151e260e22eeacc66deae25af9756111928f47f46f269e6`
passed an actual released-0.5.11/schema-17 upgrade, byte-exact database-family
undo, reapply, prerequisite write, and stale-undo refusal. All 119 source,
manifest, lockfile, and toolchain files matched the build worker. A second
reader checked those hashes after the commits: only the separately edited
capabilities file differed. This candidate is a development build, not a
replacement for the immutable v0.5.12 release artifact.

Strict RCH passed 3,097 library tests, with nine pre-existing ignored tests;
205 lifecycle, 239 error, 14 real MCP, 161 schema-migration, 170 sync-safety,
185 reconciliation, 163 capacity-scope, 196 CRUD, and 17 hash-parity tests.
The affected property, snapshot, documentation, and AGENTS-contract targets
also passed. Counts include shared helper tests, not unique independent
scenarios. Whole-target/all-feature check and Clippy passed. This is an
affected-target matrix, not a claim that every release-profile target ran.

Original failures remain retained: cold compiles reached the unchanged RCH
caps; one new clear-field assertion incorrectly expected an empty string
instead of an omitted field; and three snapshots needed the intentional
schema/help additions. Manual snapshot edits were bounded to those additions,
with inverse checks preserving every unrelated byte. A stale MCP executable
initially reported 13 tests after the source contained 14. Matching source
hashes did not prove the executable was fresh: preserved source timestamps
preceded completion of an older compilation. Touching only source metadata
and rerunning produced the named new race and all 14 passes.

Two separately compiled, deliberately incorrect implementations were tested:
vacuous checklist completion, then use of the stored prerequisite value.
Each made the existing CLI regression fail because it admitted a forbidden
replacement (exit 0 instead of 4). Both production files were manually
restored and compared byte for byte with their saved correct versions.
Retained mutant binaries also reproduced prose-only and unchecked-replacement
admission in separate durable workspaces; their receipts identify the invalid
state changes and are negative controls, not product passes. The initial
Cargo test workspaces used the existing temporary-workspace cleanup; the
separate reproductions retain database, command streams, and before/after
state. The first reproduction's Python observer did not explicitly close its
read connection and was slow; the second explicitly closes it before writes.

During command discovery, `capabilities` incorrectly described structured
errors as stderr output and classified gate/capacity commands as unknown and
text-only. Bead bs36u corrects the existing metadata. Its new real workflow
contract test first failed on the old classification, then the full 176-test
schema target passed with actual JSON and TOON gate report/list and capacity
grant/renew/history/revoke commands. An existing real-error test now compares
the published guarantee with observed stdout JSON and stderr plain errors.

Evidence is retained under
`/data/tmp/br-g8cib-prerequisite-20260909-QV5BvoMg`, with the actual migration
workspace at `/data/tmp/br-g8cib-live-upgrade-by_6900g`. UBS reports are not
clean: the capabilities scan reports one existing test-panic critical and
233 warnings; broader prerequisite scans include existing test panics and
SQL/non-secret-comparison heuristics. No blanket scanner pass is claimed.
The final MCP extensions passed all 14 tests: missing/null/empty/whitespace
presence refusals, prose/checked presence handoffs, mixed-checklist refusal,
and unrelated title/comment/dependency preservation through real import.
The first extended run passed 13 and failed one because its assertion omitted
CLI show's `dependency_type` key. The corrected helper checks each surface's
exact keys rather than using a permissive fallback. Both failure workspaces
remain on the worker. Final source check, Clippy, formatting, and diff checks
passed after the last edit. The final MCP test file hash is
`d4ab1c3c2feac494f5e17f7a3e51b553fc74d280eaae547b0941ad3214db3d86`.

An independent bs36u verifier exercised all eight contracts and all six
examples' argument parsing and workspace admission with candidate SHA-256
`4a2ff194921ac5418479d8031be82933eccff6d7bd39f1794e9763b3b7c16267`.
It returned `NOT_INITIALIZED` JSON on stdout with empty stderr from outside
a workspace. Successful mutations are established by the full schema tests;
plain rendering was source-reviewed. The implementation bead g8cib closes
under its original criterion; its separate verification companion 7zm00
retains the outstanding release-profile maintenance run. No overall feature
release or full release-profile suite pass is claimed.

### September 9 — class-specific workflow routes

Bead 8dtr0 implements the requested additional workflow edge using the existing
issue type. `workflow.class_transitions` is a list of exact type/from/to rules;
global routes and initial admission remain authoritative. The storage
transaction evaluates the prospective type before required fields, gates,
and capacity. A related storage gap was fixed: an explicit same-status update
must still satisfy a newly loaded strict status vocabulary. Explicit audited
bypass behavior is preserved.

The candidate at SHA-256
`217bdef62139e935f0d727c319dfb66cf398e2a053f7f745d86797d007e8f2b5`
passed 3,110 all-feature library tests (nine pre-existing ignores), 242 CLI
error tests, 18 actual MCP protocol tests, 163 capacity-scope tests, and 161
documentation examples. These target counts include shared helpers. Final
whole-target/all-feature Clippy, check, formatting, and whitespace checks
passed. All 1,155 tracked source/test/build-input files in the recorded
manifest matched the worker after the Clippy-only test correction removed
raw-string delimiter hashes without changing YAML fixture bytes.

An independent reviewer executed 21 fresh CLI calls against the preserved
binary. A matching bug and a task changed into a bug took the additional edge;
an ordinary task used the global planning route. Initial, nonmatching,
unknown-type, prospective bug-to-task, and omitted close-edge refusals kept
the persistent database/WAL/journal/export bytes unchanged. The original
broader file comparison failed on SHM byte 104 (`aReadMark[1]`), which is
retained as a coordination-state observation; whole-family byte identity is
not claimed. This review did not independently rerun the MCP or concurrency
matrix.

Original failures are retained: a default-only policy-field inventory missed
the omitted-when-empty class field, two new MCP close requests used an
unsupported `force` argument, and Clippy found needless raw-string hashes.
Both policy inventory assertions remain intact and now inspect populated
serialization; corrected MCP requests still require the same policy errors
and unchanged state. Two cold dependency checks reached RCH's unchanged
300-second cap before a warmed-worker check passed. An overlapping check was
refused before execution by active-project exclusion; local fallback stayed
disabled. A compiled old-type mutant made the existing storage test fail by
incorrectly admitting a task into `open`; the correct source was restored
byte for byte before the passing suite. No mutant was committed.

Evidence remains in `/data/tmp/br-g8cib-prerequisite-20260909-QV5BvoMg` and
the independent workspace `/data/tmp/br-8dtr0-independent-1xxhp7ya` on ovh-a.
UBS remains non-clean: policy/CLI/MCP source reported two critical findings,
storage 220, and the two integration files 17. Reported samples include
existing test panics, non-secret comparisons, fixture SQL, and a false
security-randomness match on `client.finish()`. No blanket warning clearance
is claimed.

The companion verification now retains successful CLI and MCP observations
through the existing test harnesses. The final CLI run passed all 242 tests
and records both rejected batch orders plus the corrected class and
prerequisite batches, including raw tables, audit rows, and JSONL. The final
MCP run passed all 18 tests, with complete request/response frames, server
stderr, successful class-transition event IDs/actors, and contention loser
projections. All original assertions, barriers, workload counts, and
timeouts remain intact. Final all-target/all-feature check and Clippy,
formatting, and whitespace checks passed. UBS on the three changed test
files reported 28 critical findings, 1,849 warnings, and 242 informational
findings; inspected critical categories were existing test panics, the
`client.finish()` randomness false match, and the fixed Cargo test executable
flagged as an untrusted command. This is not a blanket scanner clearance.

The retained CLI log is `companion-cli-complete-batch-traces.log` (SHA-256
`fac25efc1c29b6013d0db6ce97473d05b7d8665484d232ba2222d4f846bd838a`);
the final MCP log is `companion-cli-mcp-full-traces-final.log` (SHA-256
`98817b956fc369abc998e14073db4cbec71bf77db1ec08036aa21606f284fd95`),
both under the evidence directory above. Their actual CLI bytes match the
independently reviewed `217bdef6...` candidate. The embedded Git SHA in that
cached build predates the dirty class implementation; source manifests and
the executable hash establish identity instead. Earlier incomplete logs
remain retained. The prerequisite companion's frozen `9ac36fa8` release-profile
run subsequently passed 170 sync-safety and 185 reconciliation tests, with no
failures, ignores, or filtered cases. RCH's source-isolation receipt and the
original fixed 1,800-second limit remain in the log
`release-sync-sixth-frozen.log` (SHA-256
`fa09aa4d9303938b71ffdd8071f375b04b32fdc5d7de62fd675414c0480ba1b6`).
The preserved release-profile executable on hz3 is
`/data/tmp/br-7zm00-prerequisite-release-20260909-0435`, SHA-256
`ddcceef81ae9aede43863d9b7722e0e91795c5a147ede40e8ce32f5b6e7aeb68`.
Earlier capped or interrupted attempts remain recorded without pass credit.
These changes remain unreleased and do not complete
the historical migration, lock fairness, or performance calibration work.

### September 9 — typed relationships and the original legacy migration

The schema-19 change makes dependency identity `(source, target, type)` across
storage, CLI/MCP removal, JSONL import/export, and additive reconciliation.
Ambiguous untyped removals refuse before mutation. Exact imported custom type
names take precedence over alias coercion; the remaining relationship keeps
its payload. Canonical schema-18 migration, typed removal, and an operator
foreign-key refusal were independently exercised with candidate
`473f315a6069693493b9c0ce766334b94294a389ad84c650d210d3c45e9abc97`.
The journal is `typed-independent-commands-and-observations.jsonl`, SHA-256
`b5f0d17c408f24f8dd9264a190bf574d8a1be96b7c14f11a18962302cec0f58e`.
An initial whole-family undo assertion failed on the namespace-use sidecar;
the narrower documented DB/WAL/SHM/journal receipt was exact. The stronger
failure and a subsequent observer field-name error remain recorded.

The separate legacy-v15 conversion now admits the exact historical table
profile only after validating declarations, indexes, values, references,
dirty hashes, and child-counter reservations. It stages raw values and row
IDs, preserves parallel and custom relationships without cycle normalization,
and establishes comments/events sequence counters from existing IDs. A
projected witness binds every table, hidden row IDs, and preserved operator
schema. The existing issues rebuild was corrected to retain sparse row IDs.
Unknown operator constraints and incoming references are not silently rebuilt.

The first complete legacy run passed 3,126 library tests with nine existing
ignores; one of 161 migration CLI tests failed because the new fallback hid
the correct canonical-table diagnostic. The assertion stayed unchanged and
dispatch was fixed. A first actual historical apply refused before installation:
all table projections matched, but recreated canonical indexes differed in
`IF NOT EXISTS` and quoting. Only independently attested managed indexes are
now excluded from the operator-schema spelling witness. The original source
database and failed candidate remain retained.

The corrected run passed 3,131 library tests and all 161 migration CLI tests.
Its preserved executable is
`/data/tmp/br-yyhki-legacy-second-ja_bdmh1/br` on ovh-a, SHA-256
`9da9cbb4892bf1a3766bf0b12a1d6d8fb0725cf1679fca21d412d5f667082c4d`.
The 1,203-file source manifest has SHA-256
`b21d6a8b8ae3cb7e2566b714495fa4e58a703b4666277af86b8bc05fda03589c`.
An independent SQLite 3.46.1 observer compared the actual 550-issue source,
successful schema-19 candidate, and undo. Every projected value, storage class,
column, and row ID in all 18 original tables matched, including 465 dependency
rows and sequence values. The three new capacity tables were empty. Eighteen
unreconstructed schema objects, including operator indexes and views, matched
exactly. Undo restored source DB SHA-256
`e9d1b5d9ab67c620cb6128709604da089b88ae1e8cdbe2ddcea0546a42abc205`
and every receipt-covered component. JSONL and the original fixture stayed
unchanged. The complete observer journal has SHA-256
`cd14815339ee8ba7410c68732272747e2a5cdb9e92e804b6eacd12ab2e578928`.

All five original workload failures subsequently passed with explicit
`BR_DATASET_REPLAY` and `BR_DATASET_REPLAY_REASON`: history restore/prune,
label list-all/rename, and the unchanged six-reader, six-iteration concurrency
workload. Their full targets passed 186, 180, and 189 tests respectively.
The original fixture deliberately retains its 550-row DB and 971-line JSONL
starting discrepancy; it was not replaced by a synthetic current-schema
tracker. Explicit replay workspaces are retained even after successful
migration. Shared registry helpers still early-return when their separate
default corpus is absent; those passes are not historical-corpus evidence.
The workload log has SHA-256
`54a801f633e700fca144e75182aada3b61016278481102cc7f0693933a08075d`.

These artifacts live under
`/data/tmp/br-yyhki-typed-20260909-r8QH57VB`. Final qualification is still open:
a subsequent review proved that folding double-quoted text case can hide a
changed SQLite CHECK constraint. That fold was removed and regression tests
added; the executable and workload results above predate this correction.
The first Clippy failure was a redundant visibility qualifier on a private
test fixture, corrected without suppression. UBS remains non-clean; the
two migration files reported 54 critical, 3,039 warning, and 364 informational
findings, including fixture panics/SQL and non-secret-token heuristics.
Release-profile verification is running under unchanged RCH time limits.
Neither yyhki closure nor a complete release-suite pass is claimed here.

The final quoted-text correction was then requalified on executable
`fcd570d76e2d443e59e0542b857ba57c19bec9ad7f15241249b191bc218cc195`,
preserved at `/data/tmp/br-yyhki-legacy-final-mzefvkdn/br` on ovh-a.
All 1,203 source-manifest entries matched the working tree before the final
checks; the manifest SHA-256 is
`ea4a0dbb9fd9693ab6b3d40d8573adc6cad74a16771ec52f796eddaefdef9465`.
The embedded Git SHA comes from a cached build and is not its source identity.
The all-feature matrix passed 3,131 library tests (nine existing ignores),
186 concurrency, 180 history, 189 labels, 22 MCP, 165 migration, 174 sync-safety,
and 189 reconciliation tests. All five original historical workloads executed
and passed; shared harness tests account for repeated per-target counts.
The matrix log SHA-256 is
`a104459a4e153a0af6fec3d6562ad53db198fc56afa9a1d52c3ca14eb4d4b5ca`.
Whole-target all-feature check and Clippy passed, followed by formatting.

The original-source canary was repeated with that final executable: apply took
1.930 seconds and exact receipt-family undo took 0.316 seconds. Independent
SQLite checks again verified all 18 projected tables, raw storage classes and
row IDs, sequence values, three empty capacity tables, foreign keys, and
integrity. The resulting DB SHA-256
`db5ede49f5505a32a452611c86077f3f9e44d9110e670a6d8a6bcf16c3e841ef`
is identical to the earlier candidate whose 18 preserved schema objects were
compared separately. The final observer journal SHA-256 is
`9e1e2946f2d230d96d80adab1d3676c4d7f995d35b602084d46cb62d01c56036`.
These are debug-profile, isolated-copy results; the live tracker is untouched.

The full changed-Rust UBS scan remains non-clean: 490 critical, 18,506 warning,
and 3,124 informational findings. Its log SHA-256 is
`f365e0fc7e7626f82777f0cb4c344b61424c647de458230b95dbe5572d38c854`;
not every warning has been individually triaged. An earlier release-library
run passed 3,051 tests with two existing ignores, but predates the final quoted
text correction and therefore does not qualify the final candidate. The first
full release-suite attempt failed during clean-overlay source transfer before
Cargo; its log is retained as `legacy-full-release-first.log`. The retry and
separate final-source release sync targets are still running. Full release
qualification, fairness, and calibrated performance remain open.

The next release-profile candidate exposed another representability boundary:
legacy dependency types `Review-Custom` and `review-custom` remained distinct
in the converted database but exported to the same normalized JSONL identity.
The source copy and successful-but-colliding export are retained on hz4 at
`/data/tmp/br-legacy-type-case-049yangm`. Admission now refuses any legacy type
whose spelling changes through the interchange model. The negative replay on
ovh-a at `/data/tmp/br-legacy-case-refusal-_bze71mr` returned `CONFIG_ERROR`
before changing the source DB hash. Lowercase custom types remain supported.

With the spelling guard and original fixed polling, release executable
`6b1dfca7489b2a10658ad2cc85776ff383fca87ba70f18510917a8f79bb1beba`, retained
at `/data/tmp/br-fixed-case-final-core-tnz0pnlu/br` on ovh-a, passed 3,051 library
tests (two existing ignores), 66 binary tests, the five original historical
workloads, and the full migration and three sync targets. A fresh independent
SQLite canary verified all 18 table projections and exact receipt-family undo
of the original 550-issue database; apply took 1.909 seconds and undo 0.324
seconds. Its candidate DB hash again matched `db5ede49…e841ef`. Complete
observations are retained beside the executable. The original fixture and
JSONL were unchanged. This executable predates the behavior-preserving helper
extraction used to fix Clippy's function-length warning, so final-source
qualification still requires that newer source to pass.

The separate aged-polling experiment was rejected and reverted. All four
release ABBA runs completed their unchanged eight-stream, 120-second workload
with zero failed or dropped operations and full final-state checks. Although
p95 improved, median latency rose from 135–154 ms to 245–249 ms. A diagnostic
trace still observed a 16.567-second wait while 23 later arrivals acquired the
lock. Those results do not establish fairness or calibrated performance.
Raw comparison and trace evidence remains on ovh-a under
`/data/tmp/br-46zqi-syscall-jwi2sl4x/`.

Qualification remains incomplete: two cold release batches reached RCH's
unchanged 30-minute limit before test execution. Local ENOSPC also truncated
one batch log and prevented a tracker export; the export was subsequently
recovered, and retries use logs in `/tmp`. Missing-`sqlite3` failures in two
sync-artifact tests passed unchanged on a worker with the actual oracle.
The detailed pending targets, source distinctions, and bounded self-review
are recorded in yyhki comment 1500. No test ignores, workload reductions,
timeout increases, GitHub Actions, or new releases were introduced.

The final helper extraction is now qualified. Default release executable
`ad56a8a4c6bfba289f88a09d95f7b0311f9ec1d5aebdca39fa10ee561bca77cc`, retained
at `/data/tmp/br-extracted-helper-release-qcef0br5/br` on ovh-a, matches all
1,203 entries in source manifest `c04f0d2c…fe2846`. Its original-copy replay
passed all 18 table projections, storage classes, row IDs, sequences, foreign
keys, integrity, and exact DB/WAL/SHM/journal undo. The complete observations
have SHA-256 `9aec283766e9c8c805f0efaeb6a13fbdf1cdac05ce6481470eae69ff961f2475`.
The same executable refused the case-distinct legacy types without changing
the source DB. Later edits changed two integration tests and documentation;
the runtime sources remain identical to this executable's inputs.

Release-profile coverage completed through bounded RCH Cargo batches for all
156 integration targets. One target contains only an existing ignored test;
no executed-test credit is assigned to it. The default library passed 3,051
tests with two existing ignores; all features passed 3,131 with nine, and no
default features passed 3,038 with two. The binary's 66 tests, all 22 enabled
MCP protocol tests, and the MCP shutdown test passed. The documentation-test
command succeeded with zero executed tests and ten existing ignores.
The last storage-model target passed all 172 tests independently of a slow
combined batch that reached the unchanged 30-minute cap. Its four remaining
storage targets then passed on the same worker using their compiled binaries.
Two redundant cold fallback builds were cancelled; their logs and cancellation
receipts remain in `/tmp`, and neither receives test credit. Target membership,
failed attempts, and individual proof logs are recorded in the yyhki bead.

The complete suite exposed two obsolete test assumptions. Schema conformance
against pinned Go `bd` 0.46.0 had omitted the previously shipped
`issues.prerequisites` column; it now asserts that exact TEXT/NOT NULL/empty
default declaration and requires the typed dependency key to match. The doctor
chokepoint test had stamped a current database as version 14 while retaining
later columns and keys. Its positive path now derives v14 from the frozen
`d1b90640` schema-15 fixture by removing the v15 gate-history table. The former
mismatched layout remains an explicit no-mutation refusal test. Existing
plan/apply/barrier/undo assertions remain, with byte-exact undo added. Both
corrected targets passed; neither required weakening production admission.

After both test corrections, whole-crate all-feature check and Clippy with
warnings denied passed, as did formatting and whitespace checks. The normal
runtime dependency closure contained no Git-authority libraries. UBS remains
non-clean: its 49 schema SQL findings are all in test fixtures, and the new
integration-file scans report fixture panics and explicit test-binary launches.
This is recorded triage, not a blanket scanner clearance. Qualification used
isolated copies and a fresh solo review; it is not independent human review,
a new release, a starvation fix, or calibrated performance acceptance.

Before landing, `origin/main` advanced to `e64aa62b`. The merge preserves
GitHub #493's operation-neutral policy error and both regression tests, while
retaining the qualified schema implementation and fixed polling. Compared
with the qualified implementation in `542537e5`, the only production change
is the policy error's display prefix. The 156-target suite above remains
pre-merge evidence; it is not a claim that every target was rerun after merging.

The merged default-release executable has SHA-256
`2ef2dde9fb8acb22813c2474ac7a4ec3858b29b1f618be277511bf69b6912a53` and is
retained at `/data/tmp/br-merged-release-t_nqi3hf/br` on ovh-a. All 1,203 source
manifest entries matched. It re-executed the original-copy
migration and exact receipt-family undo, preserving every raw projection
and the original JSONL. The full observation journal has SHA-256
`48dc77b4401eef00f97d966533ba1972f5c6c6d476eb71aaf0f134f96c0d2e5b`.
The case-spelling refusal also preserved the database. Its observer initially
omitted `its` from the expected diagnostic substring; the corrected observer
checked the retained output and hashes without rerunning or changing the CLI.

Merged-source all-feature/all-target check and Clippy passed through strict
RCH. The first check attempt failed at SSH before Cargo started; its retry
passed. Default release passed 3,052 library tests, 66 binary tests and all
12 selected integration targets, including the new policy regression.
The no-default-feature library passed 3,039 tests. Existing ignores remain:
two in each library run and eleven in text conformance. The merged-file UBS
scan remains non-clean; the final changed-code review does not claim a
blanket clearance of existing whole-file findings. Completed logs and the
source manifest are also retained under
`/data/tmp/br-yyhki-typed-20260909-r8QH57VB/`.

The merged all-feature release library subsequently passed 3,132 tests with
nine existing ignores; all 22 MCP protocol tests and the shutdown test passed.
The MCP executable is retained at `/data/tmp/br-merged-mcp-_vjzly5k/br` on hz3
with SHA-256
`08c23c6f12e866f6dbef928affb6e1a72a8f4260228ccfdb1e6a3cd2229ca7eb`.
The all-feature and no-default-feature workers each matched 868 source inputs;
335 historical performance artifacts were absent, with no other missing or
changed input. These runs provide feature coverage, not performance calibration.
The final review and original-data replays were performed by the implementing
agent; they are not independent human verification. No GitHub Actions were used.

The subsequent `origin/main` update to `21becc16` contained byte-identical
Rust sources, tests, manifest, lockfile and build script. Its history was
merged with only this research-note reconciliation; the runtime and test
inputs qualified above did not change.

## 2026-09-09 — Ordered workspace waiters and native Windows recovery

This narrow update covers the landed waiter implementation in `e752c86d`,
the concurrency regressions in `5519f01b`, the unchanged-behavior fast-path
cleanup in `11468bbb`, and native archive exclusions in `b9eff611`.
Git diffs and the `beads_rust-46zqi` issue thread were examined. GitHub's API
confirmed the representative implementation and archive commits are live.
The latest published release remains v0.5.12, published at
2026-09-09T02:07:08Z; these commits are outside that release.

The V3 source manifest contains 1,203 inputs. Its retained release executable
on ovh-a is `/data/tmp/br-46zqi-queue-v3-H9HqM9Mf/br`, SHA-256
`3e672d5403e8f0fda54c73d70537ad903b47f2b04fc2062e5356b8c6e401e523`.
Default release library tests passed 3,058 tests with two existing ignores;
the concurrency target passed all 187. All-feature/all-target check and
Clippy with warnings denied passed through RCH. The preceding V2 sync-safety
batch passed 1,587 test invocations; it is preceding-source evidence, not
a rerun of those nine targets after the two V3 lint fixes. UBS remains
non-clean; no blanket scanner clearance is claimed.

Four eight-stream, 120-second correctness runs used the same preserved
baseline, candidate, and checker on shared ovh-a. All passed the complete
linearizability and final-state oracle, with no failed calls or dropped creates.
The original 100-operation floor and 30-second lock deadline were unchanged.

| Run | Operations | Mutation p50 | Mutation p99 | Longest mutation | CPU per operation |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| A1 baseline | 1,978 | 493 ms | 3,373 ms | 8,862 ms | 77.59 ms |
| B1 candidate | 1,656 | 845 ms | 1,496 ms | 2,185 ms | 82.09 ms |
| B2 candidate | 1,638 | 850 ms | 1,607 ms | 2,145 ms | 86.00 ms |
| A2 baseline | 1,665 | 476 ms | 5,644 ms | 13,494 ms | 81.96 ms |

CPU per operation divides the checker's total user-plus-system CPU time,
including child processes, setup, and final-state checks, by recorded calls.
It is not an isolated measurement of lock acquisition cost.

The maximum number of Applied peer calls wholly inside a mutation call was
74/1/1/43. These are whole CLI intervals, not measured lock-acquisition
intervals. Candidate tails improved in both pairs, but median calls became
longer, CPU per operation rose about 5–6%, and throughput fell by different
amounts in the two pairs. Shared load and a 37-minute gap between B1 and B2
preclude calibrated performance claims. Neither baseline reproduced the
original starvation timeout, so `beads_rust-46zqi` remains open.

Raw histories, logs, CPU accounting, source identities, and input checksums
are retained under `/tmp/br-46zqi-queue-v3-abba-evidence-20260909/` locally and
`/data/tmp/br-46zqi-queue-v3-H9HqM9Mf/abba-*-120/` on ovh-a. The local
`analysis.json` has SHA-256
`fe4c1c1719bf71668ee3709dfa96e753f5c6c2d41170a66a97ea1b7cfba80b89`.

Native Windows queue and CLI lifecycle checks passed.
Worker repairs restored SSH,
selected the verified MSVC linker, and corrected RCH's recovery rejection of
NTFS's unavailable Unix inode count. The root dispatcher automatically
passed its retained recovery probes and configured `rustc --version` canary
at 18:41:47 UTC. This is recovery evidence, not a project test pass.
The first native release test build exceeded its unchanged 30-minute budget
at 18:23:05 UTC without executing tests. No compiler processes remained when
inspected at 18:55–18:56 UTC; the retry started at 18:58:18 UTC using the
retained cache. The second dispatcher's repaired executable was initially
staged while active jobs finished. No GitHub Actions or new release were used
for this work.

At 19:30:37 UTC the second dispatcher was also upgraded after a successful
drain. Both running executables match SHA-256
`e76d7fafb14fa8dcfcdcb3e06f0913aa92e77be888eff4714bdde3378732608a`;
both original executables were retained. Live capability refreshes confirmed
the installed Windows and Linux toolchains. All 868 required source and
fixture files on Windows matched the V3 manifest. The warm native invocation
had timed out at 19:28:48 UTC; its surviving compiler was left undisturbed
until it exited, and no test executable was found. That attempt remains a
failure, not a native test pass.

The native compiler exposed two unused-import warnings. Imports used only
by Unix tests were moved into those existing test scopes in `doctor.rs` and
the sync command; no test gate, assertion, or runtime behavior changed.
The third native attempt reused the completed dependency cache and reported
neither import warning. Its 13 pre-existing dead-code warnings remain.
The import-only source passed all-feature/all-target Linux `cargo check`
through RCH in 180 seconds after two capped cold/warming attempts and one
startup-inventory refusal. Matching all-feature/all-target Clippy with warnings
denied passed in 231 seconds.
Formatting and whitespace checks passed. The two-file UBS scan remains
non-clean: 77 critical, 4,003 warning, and 1,074 informational findings; the
import-only review is not a blanket clearance of those files.

At 19:52:13 UTC the native Windows invocation completed successfully through
RCH after 13 minutes 10 seconds of release compilation. All three selected
`workspace_waiter` library tests executed and passed; none failed or were
ignored, and 2,517 unrelated tests were filtered. They cover simultaneous
registration, fast-path bypass prevention, timeout cleanup, ordered promotion,
and abandoned waiters. The log is
`/tmp/br-46zqi-windows-imports-native-tests-20260909.log`.
The 41,137,152-byte test executable was retrieved and independently checksummed
at `/tmp/br-46zqi-windows-native-unit-20260909.exe`, SHA-256
`0a4567e593528272cf14b517c75f5c48f093f72e5c5ff2d861f21a94856b5089`.
All 868 required inputs had passed the current-source manifest check before
compilation; its manifest SHA-256 is
`1098fbf692f4abbe182d34eb18c18b5dd7a9bf692ac02281a97e71020caffe64`.

The first two CLI lifecycle dispatches transferred source but refused before
Cargo because the dependency probe exceeded its 20-second SSH budget. Their
failures and refused local fallback are retained in
`/tmp/br-46zqi-windows-native-lifecycle-20260909.log` and
`/tmp/br-46zqi-windows-native-lifecycle-retry-20260909.log`. Read-only direct
manifest probes subsequently passed in 0.66–1.26 seconds. An unrelated native
FrankenTerm build was active and left untouched; its presence alone does not
establish the cause of either timeout.

The third unchanged lifecycle dispatch uploaded source in 9.45 seconds,
verified all 161 dependency preflight entries, and started native Cargo at
20:03:15 UTC. Its log is
`/tmp/br-46zqi-windows-native-lifecycle-retry2-20260909.log`. It reached the
unchanged 1,830-second SSH deadline at 20:33:45 UTC before executing the test;
this is another failed invocation. All 868 required local inputs still match
the source manifest. Before timeout, two native compilers were building the
application library under the owned Cargo process. The worker's 16 GiB RAM
was pressured by concurrent builds; Windows expanded its system-managed
pagefile. No system setting or unrelated process was changed. The surviving
Cargo process continued into the CLI and lifecycle-test targets. By 20:50 UTC
it and its children had exited, and both completed executables were present.
No source transfer or second Cargo build overlapped those surviving compilers.

The normal strict-RCH retry on `wsurf` then passed at 20:51:41 UTC:

```bash
cargo test --locked --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc \
  --test e2e_basic_lifecycle --jobs 1 -- --exact e2e_basic_lifecycle --nocapture
```

It reused the completed artifacts. Exactly one test executed and passed in
9.20 seconds, with zero failures or ignores and 202 unrelated tests filtered.
The complete remote Cargo command took 43.6 seconds. Its eight real CLI calls
covered init, create, update, JSON/text list, JSON/text show, and close; every
call exited zero with empty stderr. The trace names the actual native CLI and
the isolated Windows workspace. The log is
`/tmp/br-46zqi-windows-native-lifecycle-final-20260909.log`.
The original cold-build timeout remains a failure; this passing warm run does
not establish that a cold build fits the dispatch budget on this 16 GiB worker.

The CLI and lifecycle-test executables were retrieved independently of RCH's
zero-file artifact return. Local checksums match the worker's checksums after
the successful run:

| Local artifact | Bytes | SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---|
| `/tmp/br-46zqi-windows-native-cli-20260909.exe` | 22,596,096 | `d0260f099d454ac99b465738fb90c1cdc4ff4e7d94ce90449fda207f560de1e6` |
| `/tmp/br-46zqi-windows-native-lifecycle-20260909.exe` | 24,846,336 | `52ec1fe3a835e1fb752b4ae8164ad8b58e5f608cbbc68ce312485a65bc3984ba` |

The final worker check also verified all 868 required source/fixture inputs;
its log is `/tmp/br-46zqi-windows-final-source-and-binaries-20260909.log`.
Five existing Windows library dead-code warnings and an MSVC linker-message
warning remain in the lifecycle transcript. Native execution is verified;
Windows warning-free qualification and the original starvation acceptance
remain separate from these passing checks.

Before saving this evidence, upstream merge `5427ea14` was integrated. Its
source delta reversed both lint fixes from `11468bbb`: it synthesized
`TryLockError::WouldBlock`, which the retained V2 Clippy log rejects for the
declared MSRV, and restored an equality expression inside `assert!`.
The guarded direct lock attempt and `assert_eq!` were restored manually.
Both versions skip the exclusive fast path while a waiter is registered;
the correction preserves that behavior. All 868 required inputs again match
the exact manifest used for the successful native runs. No new Windows
behavior or new native-build result is claimed for this reconciliation.

The final all-feature/all-target Linux check passed on ovh-a in 289 seconds;
the first selected worker, hz4, had refused admission for stale disk-pressure
telemetry before running Cargo. The first final Clippy attempt on hz3 reached
its unchanged 300-second cold-build cap. The warm retry then passed with
warnings denied in 246 seconds at 21:08:41 UTC. The complete logs are
`/tmp/br-46zqi-final-merge-check-ovh-20260909.log` and
`/tmp/br-46zqi-final-merge-clippy-hz3-warm-20260909.log`.
The scoped final UBS scan remains non-clean: 189 critical, 3,224 warning, and
932 informational findings in `src/sync/mod.rs`. Restoring the already-tested
source does not claim to clear that file's broader scanner findings.

## 2026-09-10 — Saved-claim eligibility

This narrow update follows `beads_rust-sb4mn`: implementation `c07f1c0f`,
storage/batch/routing regressions `ea4b3bd5`, integration documentation
`9a38fa85`, actual process tests `08723c51`, and test-only platform imports
`01272585`. Their complete relevant diffs and the issue thread were reviewed.
GitHub's API confirmed the representative commit links and the latest published
release, v0.5.12 at `366c69a6`, published September 9 at 02:07:08 UTC.
The claim changes are Unreleased.

The retained release accepted a saved claim after a future deferral, setting
an assignee and `in_progress` while leaving the future date. This observed
sequential stale-readiness defect motivated shared CLI/storage validation and
an exact comparison of the approved assignee, status, and deferral inside the
write transaction. The old threaded storage tests serialized connections;
their names now say so. New tests instead observe two real CLI processes
waiting on the actual workspace lock. They establish the exercised admission
outcomes, without claiming an engine-internal interleaving proof.

The expanded Linux test-profile run passed 20 claim integration tests across
four targets; the library claim filter passed 19. The isolated candidate is
`/data/tmp/br-sb4mn-candidate-hz4-20260910/br`, SHA-256
`d050b484672ac2eb3ad77f966911b2f4f3da7eaef2b78dd1c1a916a1b5897fa4`.
An actual installed-BV replay saved its generated argv while work was open,
deferred the issue, then executed that unchanged argv: exit 4, unchanged issue
and JSONL. Explicit undefer followed by the same argv succeeded. All 12 calls
are retained in `/data/tmp/br-sb4mn-viewer-replay-20260910-_un_wm9l`.

LavenderBridge independently passed all 18 viewer cases against this candidate.
The same four new future/hard-deferral cases failed against the installed
release through actual mutation. Two viewer helpers first needed to parse
stdout separately from retained stderr diagnostics; the initial failed run
remains evidence. No refusal or state-preservation assertion was weakened.
This is isolated consumer qualification, not an installed or released canary.

The release-profile candidate also passed that complete 12-call replay:
`/data/tmp/br-sb4mn-release-local-20260910-zmpdipwh/br`, SHA-256
`72f5d9ba2b7f530f5243f84a3b815021c765a17fec4b837e4fded3984541e07f`.
Its evidence is `/data/tmp/br-sb4mn-viewer-replay-20260910-wpn0a_t4`.

Broader qualification exposed two harness problems. The doctor source scan
mistook a test-only import's cfg attribute for the test-module boundary;
it now requires the actual module declaration and retains both fixer-ID
consistency assertions. The release library then passed 3,058 tests with
two existing ignores. Eight sync/VCS targets passed 1,414 invocations, while
two tests in `e2e_sync_artifacts` failed because hz3 lacked `sqlite3`.
The original failing logs remain
`/tmp/br-sb4mn-release-maintenance-20260910.log` and
`/tmp/br-sb4mn-release-boundary-fixed-20260910.log`.

The older concurrency helper also skipped its independent SQLite integrity
check when the executable was missing. That happened in the initial two-process
run: its scheduling and state assertions passed, but this oracle did not run.
The helper now fails on a missing checker. Matching packaged SQLite 3.46.1
executables were provisioned on hz3/hz4, with byte identity and real probes
verified. The unchanged integrity assertions then passed in all 189 release
concurrency tests and all 173 sync-artifact tests, with no ignores or checker
skips. A separate real missing-checker control failed at the required oracle;
its initial missing-`CARGO_BIN_EXE_br` setup failure is retained separately.
See `/tmp/br-sb4mn-required-checker-release-20260910.log` and
`/tmp/br-sb4mn-missing-checker-negative-pinned-20260910.log`.

Final all-feature/all-target Cargo check and Clippy with warnings denied passed
through RCH. All 868 worker inputs matched manifest SHA-256
`27f4ad962540cc329e9d5868ec0b8dcdc9d68774ba370b44b24c168889ad58f4`.
Later source changes after the release-binary replay concern only test helpers
and documentation. The normal all-feature runtime dependency tree contains
no Git-authority package. The library, nine sync/VCS targets, and concurrency
target are the executed release scope; this was not a whole-crate integration
run. UBS remains non-clean, with bounded changed-hunk review on the issue.
This work has not run a new Windows claim canary, published a release, or used
GitHub Actions.

## 2026-09-10 — Expired lock-wait admission

This narrow Unreleased change belongs to `beads_rust-46zqi`. The shared lock
retry loop at `ab63b68d` checked its timeout before sleeping, then could acquire
and return a lock after the deadline without checking again. The GitHub API
still identifies v0.5.12 at `366c69a6` as the latest release; no new release or
tag is part of this repair.

Strict RCH job `j-30015430739361860` reproduced the defect on hz2 using the
retained `e7c1ea94` release-perf executable, SHA-256
`950ef5a75df198eb6b67a34cb86aba6219325d88ab4094279d0da87a542bd8b2`.
The probe held the real workspace lock, observed the registered writer in
`hrtimer_nanosleep`, stopped that child for 1,200 ms against a 1,000 ms budget,
released the owner and resumed the writer. It incorrectly exited zero and
created the issue. A positive control with a 5,000 ms budget and 50 ms pause
also succeeded. Both real workspaces and complete outputs remain at
`/data/tmp/br-46zqi-deadline-evidence-20260910-uzZxNlmi/br-46zqi-deadline-9ffrykbt`
and on hz2 at `/data/tmp/br-46zqi-deadline-9ffrykbt`.

The repair checks expiry after the polling sleep and queue scan, and again
immediately after contended acquisition. It retains the uncontended
nonblocking fast path, configured budget, polling interval, identity checks
and OS lock authority. Linux process regressions exercise both resume
outcomes; the expired case also requires unchanged database/WAL/JSONL bytes,
registration cleanup and one successful retry. The pre-fix Rust regression
failed as expected (expired writer exited zero); its within-budget control
passed. After rebuilding the candidate, strict RCH job
`j-30015430739361877` passed all 191 concurrency tests on hz3. The first
candidate attempt had reused the baseline executable because its build
finished after the edited source timestamps; that failed run is retained,
and refreshing the two source mtimes caused an actual recompilation.

Final all-feature/all-target Clippy with warnings denied passed on hz4 in
`j-30015430739361878`, followed by matching Cargo check in
`j-30015430739361888`. Formatting and whitespace checks passed. The resolved
normal all-feature dependency tree contains no Git-authority package
(`j-30015430739361885`). An isolated Cargo home first bypassed hz2's registry
source error. Inspection then found its RCH cache's `hex-0.4.3` source entry
missing `Cargo.toml` and the source files. The damaged entry was preserved and
only missing files restored; the ordinary RCH cache subsequently passed the
same tree query (`j-30015430739361896`). The original failures and non-clean
UBS output are retained.

The complete release run (`j-30015430739361886`) exposed two stale init
snapshots: commit `e752c86d` added `.write-waiters.lock/` to the generated
`.gitignore`, but the text snapshot omitted it and the directory snapshot
still expected 1,247 rather than 1,268 bytes. Both existing snapshots were
corrected manually after reviewing that exact 21-byte difference. The initial
failures remain in `full-release-suite-hz3.log`. The clean-commit rerun on
hz2 (`j-30015430739361937`, base `2c8cb980`) passed all 167 tests with zero
failures or ignores at 01:40:16 UTC on September 11. Its complete receipt is
`golden-init-clean-commit-rerun-hz2-j2.log` in the same evidence directory.
The 501-entry source manifest still matches the local and worker Rust inputs;
it does not cover `.snap` files. The corrected snapshot hashes are
`292225c28e2d7763a3e9286bb13c675a318a144707fba7a746239a2b9c40b7ab`
(directory listing) and
`09c5deb95607825b9704ec801ea0dd336733b0f2fcb2f94093c5d23dfda4ffcc`
(text contents).

Native qualification required repairing the Windows RCH worker. Its old
capability scans had accumulated 41 simultaneous probes. The RCH changes
cache verified Rustup inventory with cross-process exclusion and a bounded
incremental scan; a separate portability fix makes the shared Cargo path
helpers available to the Windows build. Strict RCH job
`j-30015430739361924` built the native worker executable, SHA-256
`e2739e2e85bd3e0efbbeeed8ac30f4ee43fed7ccc935e29185a34f6be56f989a`.
On Windows, the first scan returned partial inventory with explicit warnings;
the next completed all 19 toolchains and 134 component facts. Two simultaneous
warm calls completed in 5.185 and 6.013 seconds with complete inventory and
fresh dynamic observations. The installed worker's previous executable was
preserved. A subsequent RCH probe succeeded, and native MSVC job
`j-30015430739361933` reached actual compilation. A fresh process inventory
showed zero capability probes, one Cargo process and one real compiler;
the old scans drained without forced termination. These receipts are in the
same evidence directory, including `windows-cache-native-warm.json` and
`windows-process-inventory-after-repair.json`.

The complete release command reached its external 7,200-second cap at
01:33:53 UTC on September 11, after 134 completed test binaries: 22,298 passing
invocations, the two stale golden failures above, and 104 existing ignores.
Its exit 137 records that timeout; it does not establish an out-of-memory
failure. Compilation consumed 66 minutes 52 seconds. The interruption occurred
in `repro_mergereport_determinism`; that target, 23 later integration targets
and doc tests required separate completion, recorded below. The resume accounting is retained in
`full-release-resume-accounting.json`. No case count or assertion was reduced.
The attempted warm resume (`j-30015430739361940`) instead started a full
dependency rebuild and was cancelled after about 48 seconds to release the
shared timing host. No tests ran. The prior test executables were absent when
inspected afterward; their loss is not attributed to a particular component.
The successful hz2 golden run's CLI and test executable were copied out and
verified against their remote hashes before planning the remaining targets.

The installed Windows worker can compile, but daemon telemetry subsequently
reopened its quarantine. The exact daemon command fails under Windows' default
command interpreter with `-v was unexpected at this time.` The shared SSH
runner had passed its POSIX script verbatim. Sending a script through `sh -s`
that executes the original command with `sh -c` and null stdin succeeded on
the same host, returning fresh telemetry in 9.019 seconds. Native controls also
preserved shell metacharacters, newlines and stdin EOF. The failure and positive
control remain in `windows-telemetry-exact-failure.json` and
`windows-telemetry-stdin-positive.json`; RCH bead `bd-squlv.1` tracks the shared
runner repair. These controls are not proof of an installed daemon fix.

The compiled shared-SSH CLI subsequently passed its native worker probe in
10.976 seconds. It reported 19 toolchains and 137 current component facts;
an initial diagnostic incorrectly expected the earlier 134 and failed. The
three additions were installed August 25 standard-library targets, with none
removed. That correction and inventory comparison are retained. The RCH
maintainer reported 6,856 passing tests and all-target check/Clippy; an
independent reviewer verified the affected SSH and shim tests and closed
the narrow telemetry repair after inspecting actual daemon evidence.

The isolated compiled daemon recorded successive fresh Windows telemetry
samples and stayed healthy with a closed circuit and zero consecutive
failures. Both shared schedulers were drained for Windows before this canary.
The production `daemon-release` build on hz2 (`j-30015430739361950`) passed
at 02:21:48 UTC. Its 22,111,496-byte executable was copied and verified against
the remote SHA-256
`cfaa93374b3e4c5b37f49d4399d2c19bf8ad736ec79c5514a66e96d550f32c20`.
After confirming no active or queued canary jobs, the owned debug daemon
stopped gracefully and the production executable started in the same isolated
configuration at 02:28:33 UTC. Shared daemon deployment is still pending.
The canary also exposed a separate benchmark caller that passes `~` through
Windows CMD; RCH bead `bd-squlv.2` tracks that distinct failure.

The original native queue command reached its SSH timeout after 3,630 seconds
without completing a test. Native process inspection afterward found no
remaining Cargo or rustc process. Its retry used a 7,200-second orchestration
allowance without changing test deadlines, assertions or counts. The repaired
scheduler admitted the retry, but the frontend failed before compilation:
its persistent source-lock command still crossed the Windows quoting boundary,
producing a `printf` usage error. A native scratch control sent the bootstrap
through `sh -s`, retained stdin to hold the lock, observed the exact ready
marker, and exited zero when stdin closed. This control identifies a repair;
it does not establish that the compiled frontend has that repair. The failed
retry and positive control are retained in
`windows-native-queue-isolated-resume.log` and
`windows-source-lock-stdin-probe.json`.

The remaining 24 Linux release targets passed from clean commit `2c8cb980`
on hz4 (`j-30015430739361945`): 2,386 passing invocations, zero failures and
zero ignores. Remote execution finished at 02:46:14 UTC; artifact retrieval
and the enclosing command completed successfully at 02:46:16. The unchanged
determinism and workspace-failure campaigns both completed. All 24 test
executables and their CLI were archived; the local archive's 25 members match
their individual remote sizes and hashes. The archive SHA-256 is
`fc52ac9a7b7674eb57eddb9e1fd37c009704efaf13eb6d2e6ffb7de260640771`.
Its optional 60-second SSH wrapper timed out before the remote archive finished
at about 65 seconds; the completed archive was then copied and verified.

Release doc tests also completed successfully on hz4
(`j-30015430739361961`, enclosing command exit zero at 03:11:41 UTC).
All ten doc examples retain their existing ignore annotations; this run adds
no passing executable examples. An earlier attempt was cancelled after it
started rebuilding dependencies and before tests. The successful invocation
used the existing stable worker Cargo home in offline mode and needed a
16-minute dependency rebuild. The former archive Cargo home was absent when
inspected; its disappearance is not attributed to a particular component.

The assembled default-feature release coverage is now complete: two unit-test
binaries, all 156 integration-test files, and doc tests. There are 24,686
passing invocations, zero final failures, 104 existing binary-test ignores
and ten existing doc-test ignores. Shared harness cases run in multiple
binaries, so these are invocation counts, not unique tests. The original
timeout and stale snapshot failures remain recorded; this was not one
uninterrupted passing command. Exact target accounting and doc output are in
`assembled-default-release-binary-results.json` and
`release-doc-tests-stable-cache-hz4.log` in the evidence directory above.

The RCH source-lock and benchmark repairs at `cc03f20d` passed 6,864 author-run
tests, all-target check and denied-warning Clippy, followed by 164 independently
executed SSH and benchmark tests with no failures or ignores. The corrected
frontend binary was copied and its hash verified after automatic retrieval
timed out. Its embedded Git label is stale; the transferred source hashes and
binary hash establish its identity separately. Native scratch controls prove
same-root lock exclusion, independent-root progress and release on stdin EOF.
Compiled native acceptance remains separate: the first small fixture attempt
was refused before dispatch because RCH inferred August 30 from the compiler
commit date instead of the inherited August 31 toolchain pin. An explicit
August 31 retry passed that check but was refused for critical memory pressure
at 03:23:50 UTC. Neither attempt reached source-lock acquisition or Cargo.

The production daemon canary continues to return fresh native telemetry with
a closed circuit and zero consecutive failures, while slow health responses
have caused several degraded transitions followed by recovery. This is not
a continuously healthy result. Other native release builds occupy the Windows
worker; no foreign processes were terminated. Current-source Windows
queue/lifecycle tests, compiled frontend acceptance, the native benchmark and
shared daemon deployment remain pending. The original sustained starvation
and calibrated release-performance acceptance also remain open. No GitHub
Actions were used for these builds or tests.
