# docs/ index

Which documents describe the code as it is, and which are historical plans.
Current documents are kept true by tests or generators where one exists; a
historical document is a record of intent and may describe modules, commands,
or numbers that never shipped or have since changed.

## Current (describes the code on `main`)

| Document | What it is | Kept true by |

| [reliability/HEALTH_CONTRACT.md](reliability/HEALTH_CONTRACT.md) | Workspace health levels and anomaly taxonomy | vocabulary from `src/health.rs` |
| [reliability/ENGINE_OPERATING_MODEL.md](reliability/ENGINE_OPERATING_MODEL.md) | FrankenSQLite decision, August 2026 incident, containment, sidecars, bump checklist | manual; receipts attached per release |

| [CI_SUPPLY_CHAIN.md](CI_SUPPLY_CHAIN.md) | Workflow action pin policy and proof commands | `tests/workflow_*.rs` |
| [perf/](perf/) | Release-latency budget calibration: the A/A precision analysis behind gating on the median alone, the permutation null study, and the 28 frozen per-workload budgets | `tests/bench_synthetic_scale.rs::the_frozen_release_latency_budgets_cover_the_canonical_matrix` cross-checks the budgets against the committed null study |
| [INSTALLING.md](INSTALLING.md), [VCS_INTEGRATION.md](VCS_INTEGRATION.md), [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) | Install, non-git VCS, troubleshooting | manual |

| [ARTIFACT_LOG_SCHEMA.md](ARTIFACT_LOG_SCHEMA.md), [WRITE_COMBINING_QUEUE_DESIGN.md](WRITE_COMBINING_QUEUE_DESIGN.md) | Artifact log schema; write-combining design (dormant module, see ARCHITECTURE.md) | manual |
| audit_*.md, snapshot_review_*.md, fsqlite_trailing_pages_report.md | Dated audit and review records | frozen |

## Historical (planning documents; do not treat as a description of the code)

| Document | Written | Why it is historical |
|---|---|---|
| [porting/PLAN_TO_PORT_BEADS_WITH_SQLITE_AND_ISSUES_JSONL_TO_RUST.md](porting/PLAN_TO_PORT_BEADS_WITH_SQLITE_AND_ISSUES_JSONL_TO_RUST.md) | 2026-01 | The port plan; some listed commands (`duplicates`, `edit`, `compact`, `cleanup`, `--robot-help`) were never built or were folded into others |
