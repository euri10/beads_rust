# Storage Engine Operating Model

**Status:** reviewed 2026-09-17. Post-0.4.4-cutover main uses the uniform
published FrankenSQLite 0.4.4 family (all 20 consumed members at 0.4.4,
commit `9d3d98778a372aba95d76d05c5c974ac0238c96a`), adopted per the
`beads_rust-0edxa` upgrade. The prior mixed family (facade/core 0.4.2,
pager 0.4.3, btree/vdbe 0.4.1, others 0.4.0) qualified under `beads_rust-otrgz`;
0.4.4 additionally carries the native-WAL abandoned-page reclamation fix
([`e21d008b4`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensqlite/commit/e21d008b4),
bd-u2kmg) and the INSERT-conflict provisional-rowid cleanup
([`725e31ee7`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensqlite/commit/725e31ee7),
bd-55kh5) noted under §7's `beads_rust-f3r4` rowid-discard limitation.
Asupersync stays exactly 0.5.0 across br, engine and FastMCP. Full 0.4.4
qualification receipts (lib 3,092, model 172, linearizability 25, repro 164,
schema-migration suite, all-target/all-features check, denied-warning clippy
lib/bins+tests, MCP 22+1, retained-family stress 8×60/8×90) live in
`UPGRADE_LOG.md` under `beads_rust-0edxa` — the upgrade is complete.

**Owner bead:** `beads_rust-dk45` (Track B of the 2026-09-01 bridge plan)

This document is the record of how `br` relates to its storage engine, what
went wrong in August 2026, what contains it today, and what must pass before
the engine is changed again. It exists because the August incident was
reconstructed from one bead's comment trail; nothing in `docs/` said any of
this.

---

## 1. The decision: FrankenSQLite only, no C SQLite

`br` links no C SQLite. The storage engine is
[FrankenSQLite](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensqlite) (`fsqlite`
family of crates, pinned in `Cargo.toml`, published on crates.io), driven
through the synchronous `src/franken_sync.rs` bridge over the engine's async
API.

Why:
- Rust safety checks throughout br (`unsafe_code = "deny"` in `Cargo.toml`,
  with three documented platform carve-outs for inode locking, SIGPIPE, and
  Windows process exit; none implements the storage engine);
- a single Rust toolchain for build, test, release, and `cargo install --git`;
- concurrent-writer support the classic engine does not offer.

What would change the decision: an engine defect that cannot be contained on
the br side **and** cannot be fixed upstream. In August 2026 a stock-SQLite
backend was built as an emergency alternative (`811c8277`, `783c1140`, released
once as v0.5.4) and the operator rejected it; it was reverted in `a704e8b8` and
`be9fc296`. That rejection is the standing decision.

## 2. What happened in August 2026

| Date | Event |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-27 | v0.5.3 (fsqlite 0.3.11) malforms migrated databases under concurrent multi-process writes: GH #457 (page aliasing), #458 (field-shifted import record), #460 (freelist corruption), #461 (`comments add` destroying prior comment bodies in `issues.jsonl`). |
| 2026-08-28 | Root cause isolated upstream: FrankenSQLite's multi-process checkpoint did not register against peer processes' read snapshots (frankensqlite #399; #385 and #329 own the fix). The engine-side discriminator showed four concurrent br-shaped processes stay clean when they never checkpoint, corrupt after several rounds with PASSIVE checkpoints at exit, and corrupt in the first round with the `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` br ran at process exit. |
| 2026-08-28 | Containment landed in `dedfbed7` (see §3). Stress receipts on worker hz3 against the real 975-issue family: before, 8 workers × 60 s left 32 self-heal recovery artifacts and "invalid B-tree page type flag: 0x00" reads; after, 8 × 60 s and 8 × 90 s ended with `integrity_check` ok, DB == JSONL, zero new artifacts, zero corruption signatures. |
| 2026-08-29 | `v0.5.4` (tag on `47fd9d0e`, the stock-SQLite build with `rusqlite 0.40.2 bundled`, no `fsqlite` dependency) was published at 04:39 UTC and superseded about an hour later by v0.5.5 on FrankenSQLite 0.3.12 with the containment below; v0.5.6 (0.3.12) and v0.5.7 (0.3.13) followed the same day. Anyone still on v0.5.4 is running the rejected backend and should upgrade. |
| 2026-09-01 | fsqlite 0.3.14 (`ebc34bd7`). GH #476 (read-only inspection appearing to write the header) traced to the WAL-index reader-mark array, which any WAL-correct reader must write; contract restated in `3d4fdc0f` and pinned at the storage layer by `beads_rust-dk45.2`. |

## 3. Containment: checkpoints only as the provable sole opener

Implemented in `src/sync/mod.rs` (`DatabaseOpenerLease`) and
`src/storage/sqlite.rs` (`admit_checkpoint`, `CheckpointAdmission`).

- Every persistent open of a database holds a **shared opener lease**, the
  file `.beads/.br-db-openers-<hash>.lock` beside the database (sibling of
  `.br-db-write-<hash>.lock`), for the lifetime of the storage handle.
- The periodic PASSIVE checkpoint, `checkpoint_full` at quiescent points, and
  the exit-time TRUNCATE (`SqliteStorage::drop`, only when the handle made
  mutations, #270) first **upgrade to the exclusive hold** and are **skipped
  when another process has the database open** (`CheckpointAdmission::PeersPresent`).
- New openers wait out an in-flight exclusive hold and refuse admission after
  five seconds; they never proceed without registration.
- A sibling `.br-db-openers-<hash>.transition.lock` serializes upgrades before
  the contender releases its shared registration. A losing contender keeps
  its shared hold, so concurrent upgrades cannot overlook each other.
- The typed exclusive hold restores shared protection on drop. If restoration
  fails, the lease retains the transition barrier until engine teardown,
  preventing other checkpoint attempts from overlooking the live handle.
  Read-only commands leave `mutation_count` at zero and never checkpoint on
  teardown. Index repair retains exclusive admission through checkpoint,
  REINDEX, connection close and any failure restore. Doctor's oversized-WAL
  truncation also requires sole-opener admission. Partial REINDEX and the
  rollback-only post-repair write probe retain shared opener registration
  and use non-checkpointing connection close. They must successfully disable
  `wal_autocheckpoint` before running SQL: a large REINDEX can otherwise
  trigger an engine checkpoint during commit while peers still hold leases.

Consequence for operators: under a busy swarm the WAL can grow because
checkpoints are skipped while peers are present; `br doctor` reports `wal_size`
and the sole-opener state (`beads_rust-dk45.5` adds an `engine` block with the
lease holder).

### Missing shared WAL index at startup

Ordinary startup can reconstruct a missing `-shm` index for an existing WAL
family before inspecting pending sync-merge metadata. It holds database-family
write authority and an exclusive opener lease, retains a complete backup, and
rehearses recovery on a private copy. The automatic path validates every physical
WAL frame, including salts, checksums, page sizes and complete frame boundaries.
It refuses damaged or ambiguous tails rather than accepting only a valid prefix.
Checksums establish internal consistency; they cannot prove that an otherwise
valid foreign WAL belongs to this database.

Recovery must preserve the main database, WAL and rollback journal bytes and
produce the same logical state as the private rehearsal. Startup then inspects
the actual recovered pending-merge receipt; it never treats unavailable metadata
as absent or reconstructs these committed rows from JSONL. A live peer prevents
this recovery. Explicit read-only fast opens (`--no-auto-import --no-auto-flush`),
observational sync modes (`--status`, `--reconcile --dry-run`), and diagnostic
doctor commands do not enter the automatic repair path. Recovery
receipts and original bytes remain under `.br_recovery/schema-migrations/`.

Read-only inspection of a missing-index family uses a private snapshot. It
retains the original opener lease, copies the complete family through retained
no-follow descriptors, and checks source identities, metadata and full content
hashes before and after recovery. The private WAL passes the same strict
validation, private recovery must preserve main/WAL/journal bytes, and integrity
must pass before returning a read handle. The live shared index remains absent;
changed or unsafe source files cause refusal. Original namespace sidecars must
still satisfy the engine's ownership and single-link rules; copying must not
hide unsafe source topology. This permits doctor and
observational sync to inspect committed rows and pending receipts without
repairing the live family.

## 4. Database family and sidecar inventory

FrankenSQLite creates these beside any database path it opens, including
`VACUUM INTO` temp targets (`src/config/mod.rs`, single source of truth for
the suffix lists; `doctor`'s family walk reads the same constants):

| File | Owner | Purpose | Doctor treatment |
|---|---|---|---|
| `beads.db` | br | main database | `db.exists`, `db.open`, `sqlite.integrity_check` |
| `beads.db-wal`, `-shm`, `-journal` | engine | classic WAL / WAL-index / rollback journal | `db.sidecars`, `wal_size`; `-shm` reader marks (offsets 100..120) are the one thing a read-only open may write |
| `beads.db-wal-cert`, `-wal-cert-head` | engine (0.2+) | parallel-WAL durability certificates | derived state; a certificate written by a different engine generation makes every cert-regenerating write fail while reads stay healthy (GH #441); br quarantines it into `.br_recovery/` so the engine regenerates it |
| `beads.db-fsqlite-ns-gate`, `-fsqlite-ns-use` | engine (0.1.18+) | multi-process namespace admission | `db.namespace_identity` compares the recorded generation with the main file before any live engine open; distinguishes a mismatch from unavailable evidence and absent sidecars. `permissions.db_sidecars` flags group/other exposure beyond what the linked engine admits; namespace identity diagnosis preserves the files and offers no namespace fixer |
| `beads.db.fsqlite-migration-state` | engine | migration bookkeeping | carried with the family |
| `.br-db-write-<hash>.lock`, `.br-db-openers-<hash>.lock`, `.br-db-openers-<hash>.transition.lock` | br | write authority, opener registration and serialized checkpoint admission | `write_lock`, engine block |
| `.br_recovery/` | br | forensic backups taken before recovery rebuilds (whole family) | `db.recovery_artifacts` (info), `db.recovery_artifacts.aged` (warn past `RECOVERY_AGED_TTL_DAYS = 30`), `db.foreign_recovery_debris` |
| `.br_history/` | br | bounded JSONL snapshots (`br history`) | `br_history.size` |

Recovery artifacts are never removed automatically; `br doctor --repair`
offers to quarantine only the aged ones. Removal is an operator decision.

FrankenSQLite 0.3.16 can rebind a copied namespace record to the current inode
when no live opener owns that generation, including on its read-only open
path. With a live generation lease, a mismatched inode remains refused.
Doctor checks the existing record through strictly read-only namespace
admission before this fallback can run. On mismatch or unavailable evidence,
it skips live database probes, reports pending-merge state as unknown, and
continues checks on private copies. Preserve the whole family for diagnosis;
a mismatch does not establish that its WAL or certificates are disposable.

FrankenSQLite 0.3.18 also admits an existing namespace sidecar whose group/other
exposure does not exceed the database file's exposure to the same principals;
group permissions require matching groups. The br permission probe already
selects this rule from the linked engine version. This permits mount-imposed
modes on FAT/exFAT or WSL drives without treating an admitted mode as a repair
finding. Owner, regular-file and single-hard-link requirements still apply.

## 5. Read-only contract (GH #476)

A current-schema read-only open (`SqliteStorage::open_current_read_only`) and
every inspection built on it leave the main file, `-wal`, and `-journal`
byte-identical and may change `-shm` only inside the WAL-index reader-mark
array (`SHM_READ_MARK_RANGE`). The contract is enforced three ways:

- `src/storage/sqlite.rs` tests `open_current_read_only_is_observational_*`
  (no WAL, live uncheckpointed WAL, leftover `-shm`);
- the doctor test for pending-merge inspection (`assert_database_family_read_only`);
- the runtime doctor check `db.read_only_open_observational`, which runs the
  same probe on a private copy of the family in every `br doctor`, so an
  engine bump that starts writing on open is caught on the installed engine
  rather than in a user's workspace.

## 6. Engine bump checklist

Before merging any change to the `fsqlite*` lines in `Cargo.toml` (Dependabot
or manual):

1. Read the fsqlite changelog for pager, WAL, B-tree, checkpoint, or VFS
   changes and note them in the PR.
2. `cargo test --lib` green (through RCH: `rch exec -- cargo test --lib`).
3. Stress gate: `scripts/br-stress.sh <br-binary> <real-.beads-dir> 8 60` and
   `... 8 90` against a real migrated family, not a fresh workspace; both must
   pass every post-condition listed in the script header (integrity ok, DB ==
   JSONL, no new `.br_recovery/` artifacts, no doctor errors, no unexpected
   stderr signatures). Attach both receipts to the PR.
4. `br doctor --json` on the stressed copy: `db.read_only_open_observational`
   and `db.sidecars` ok.
5. `cargo test --test model_based_storage` (random operation sequences against
   the engine-free reference model) and
   `cargo test --test linearizability_multiprocess -- --nocapture` (eight
   concurrent `br` process streams for 30 s; every per-issue history must
   linearize against the sequential model and the published JSONL must equal
   the linearized final state) green. Both run in the CI and release
   reliability jobs; a violation writes the merged history and the failing
   partition under `target/test-artifacts/linearizability/`.
6. Re-run the repro tests for the open engine escalations (§7); record which
   ones now pass and remove the matching workarounds in the same PR.

A release without these receipts is not a release.

## 7. Open upstream escalations

| Bead | Symptom in br | Upstream |
|---|---|---|
| `beads_rust-otrgz`, `beads_rust-nx2sh` (published engine fix adopted) | Concurrent CLI reads could make MCP startup's authority-bound pending-sync inspection fail with database busy before FastMCP dispatch. The same-current-source startup probe failed 10/20 rounds on 0.4.0 and passed 20/20 with the published fix. | The read-only WAL bootstrap formerly requested exclusive maintenance while adopting an existing WAL locally. The [`683a241b` fix](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensqlite/commit/683a241bc3830a500bfcb8f9e5380e57fdebcf9c) uses local mode adoption and shared-snapshot validation; published facade/core 0.4.2 and pager 0.4.3 carry it. Qualification passed 3,161 library cases, all 22 MCP protocol cases, 25 multiprocess linearizability cases and 172 model-based cases, plus both real-family stress gates and the full concurrency/replay targets. Exact inputs, ignores and receipts are in `UPGRADE_LOG.md`; these passes do not replace release qualification. |
| `beads_rust-ro3m` (engine fix verified) | Grouped/HAVING IN-subquery counts returned NULL with bound parameters and trailing predicates on 0.3.15/0.3.16. All four original `grouped_having_in_subquery_count_with_bound_params` variants pass on 0.3.18 (2026-09-07); the probe is now a normal regression test and the multi-label AND count detour is removed. `multi_label_and_count_matches_list` guards the public result. | [frankensqlite#407](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensqlite/issues/407), fixed after the v0.3.16 tag; the pinned 0.3.18 release carries the correction |
| `beads_rust-f3r4` | B-tree rowid-order corruption after 264 sequential dep-remove writes (GH #426) | not filed: the #426 sequence passes on fsqlite 0.3.15; `gh426_sequential_dependency_removals_keep_projections_and_integrity` (tests/model_based_storage.rs) guards it |
| `beads_rust-ajui` | migrate-schema 16→17 reports success but leaves the DB failing `integrity_check` (GH #428) | not filed: br-side fix landed (migration requires a clean fresh-connection integrity witness, `doctor_subsystems/schema_migration.rs`; `tests/e2e_schema_migration_upgrade.rs`); bead closed |
| `beads_rust-891u` | `VACUUM INTO` re-serializes DDL so the raw `sqlite_master` hash never matches the witness | not filed (re-serialized DDL is not an upstream defect once the witness ignores formatting); br-side landed: the witness hashes DDL tokens (`ddl_token_fingerprint`, `schema_witness_survives_vacuum_into_reserialization`) |
| `beads_rust-avhq` | orphaned `-wal-cert`/`-ns` sidecars wedge open when the DB file is absent | br-side landed: `quarantine_orphaned_sidecars` before the fresh install (`tests/repro_avhq.rs`) |
| resolved | GH #457/#460/#461 page aliasing under concurrent checkpoints | frankensqlite #399 (fix tracked in #385, #329); contained by §3 |
| resolved | trailing zero pages rejected where SQLite accepts them | `docs/fsqlite_trailing_pages_report.md` |

`beads_rust-dk45.6` gives each open row a `tests/repro_*.rs` and an upstream
issue link.

## 8. Escalation template

When filing upstream, include:

```
Engine: fsqlite <version> (Cargo.lock), br <version> (<commit>)
Platform: <os/arch>, filesystem <type>
Workload: <br-stress.sh args or command sequence>, N processes, duration
Symptom: <exact error text or integrity_check output>
Artifacts: .br_recovery/<ts>/ listing, doctor --json (engine block, db.* checks),
           byte offsets when a family file changed unexpectedly
Repro: <tests/repro_*.rs name or shell sequence, minimal>
Containment on br side: <what br does today to avoid it>
```

Link the upstream issue from the bead and from this table.
